00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, hello, PaweÅ‚ Malik, Portal Analiz. It is a pleasure for me to welcome today the representatives of the company Sanex,

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
i.e. Mr. Romuald Kaliciak and Mr. Marc Kosman. Hello, gentlemen.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sanex is definitely one of the stars of last year. At the beginning of last year, I will remind you, we had a webinar with the current gentlemen from the office.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
At that time, it was a very optimistic attitude, but with some concerns about the costs, in particular the costs of steel.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
However, it turned out that this year was phenomenal and probably exceeded your expectations. I think we will hear that for sure.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
However, of course, what interests us most is not only history, but also the future, which can be expected in the upcoming 2023.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I think the environment will benefit, as the gentlemen have prepared for it. I give you my voice. I know that there will be a presentation at the beginning.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
After the presentation, there will be time to ask questions. You can already enter the questions in the chat, which I will read out at the end of the presentation.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, once again, Mr. Witam, I give you my voice. Thank you very much.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We have prepared a short presentation here to make it easier to ask questions and show our company what has changed this year, that year, actually.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And show a few directions or proposals for the development of our company in the coming years, in particular this year.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, one by one, first of all, such basic information about the company for those of you who may not know us yet, but would like to better understand what the company is doing.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then a short presentation of the financial results for the last year.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then information about the market, where we sell, to whom we sell, on which markets, to whom we would like to sell and a overview of the most important events that have been happening in our company for the last year.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, as we have already been presented, we will try today with Mr. Mark, who is our member of the financial detector management and, in my opinion, to present in such a way that everyone will be able to draw from it the information that we intend.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So, let's start with the company. The company has a lot of experience in relation to all products and all technologies that have been used since the very beginning of the renewable energy industry.

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We have an experience of 20 years, as it was shown here, although the company started in 1997 as a different subject in this industry.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Here we show our company, as if in such a basement, as it was shown here, that is, we show a large range of our products, we show future directions, such as fruit, we show the results that have grown very nicely for us here in that year, so we would like to focus on this now, in particular.

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What are we specializing in here? Our company, from my point of view, is mistakenly, every time it is encrypted into some parts of this large range of renewable energy products.

20
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So at the beginning it was that we were encrypted into solar generators, which were considered products that no longer sell, later there were photovoltaics, which, due to the lack of funding, also stopped selling.

21
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now there are heat pumps that can play a big role, or not, so we have to see that this is a product that is largely dependent on the level of funding and the price of energy.

22
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We produce a whole range, i.e. here, regardless of which product or which product range would be at the top, so to speak, this is how it is produced here.

23
00:04:35,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So we produce a whole range of heat pumps, a whole range of solar, flat, or vacuum collectors, we produce power systems for photovoltaics, we finish the construction of the hall, we already produce in a very large number of containers, we produce glycol, we produce various chemical products that are used to clean or fill solar installations,

24
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:17,000
or to install heat pump cleaners. We produce controllers, we produce heat accumulators on the basis of phase cross-section of the solar panel, so here we have the whole range.

25
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Here we show our experience in research and development activities. Every company that wants to play an innovative role or take part in the construction of the energy and wind energy market, from my point of view, should have a very well-developed research and development department.

26
00:05:43,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The development department is the place of the company that decides on the directions that should be examined, it should introduce certain products, certain technological thoughts that could be transferred to the construction or creation of products that would be sold.

27
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And it has given us the need to sell the whole system, not only the individual elements of the system, but also the whole system.

28
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And as a confirmation, our research and development department works quite vigorously. These are donations that we received from companies for innovative solutions, there are quite a few, I think, especially we are proud of this autonomous heating system,

29
00:06:39,000 --> 00:07:00,000
because it is a program that we are doing with the National Development Fund, a research program, and it shows our ability to create new, technologically advanced solutions and later commercialization of these solutions and operations of these clients.

30
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Our company also has a number of different certificates that allow our products, both for heating and solar collectors, first of all, to be allowed to be sold on the Western European market and also allows the participation, funding for final customers of these devices.

31
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This indicates that these devices are highly efficient and economical. Yesterday we managed to extend the ISO 9000 certificate for the entire company.

32
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Now we would like to show you some financial data, because it is certainly very interesting. It's nice that we have a research and development department, that everything is developing, but all of this has to be converted into financial results later.

33
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And indeed, here we have a comparison after three quarters, how much we have managed to improve profitability, i.e. these fears that the growth of the cost of raw materials, in general, the cost of activities last year, we managed to keep all these costs in our pockets.

34
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And if we have an increase in revenues at the level of over 100%, then we have an increase in profitability at the level of 270%.

35
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So you can see that this additional developed margin has been very nicely converted into financial results for our profits. These are, of course, data after three quarters, full financial data annually, because they will be published more in a month.

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We also invite you to get acquainted with this. For sure, there will be no negative surprises at the end of the year, this trend will be maintained until the end of the year.

37
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Here you can see nicely on the charts how we have grown in the last year, when it comes to revenues, and here are the annual revenues, because we have already shown them to the public, and net profit after three quarters of the year 2022, we have a significant increase in profits in 2021.

38
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It can be said that we have managed to improve revenues very much this year and at the same time maintain the costs of activities, first of all, the costs of a few raw materials, and the personal costs of raw materials.

39
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Now we will move on to the information about the market, who are we selling to, who would we like to sell to, what does it look like?

40
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, if the financial results presented here were excellent, then the product that we have produced should be found by the buyer.

41
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Here we can see that our main market, which is the German market and the Polish market, are different.

42
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
However, we would like to change this a little bit.

43
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
On this slide we show which are the key countries for us in the discussion.

44
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We see Germany, Austria, Italy, Germany and a few other countries that we will try to satisfy in a greater way, as well as expand the countries that are not yet the appropriate colors on this map.

45
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
These are the new countries, such as France, Spain or England, where these products are very popular.

46
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Here we show our two main countries, where we are trying to exist to a greater extent, which are Germany and Austria.

47
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Austria, through the purchase of a company that deals with assembly, which is a large company in Austria, which is known and recognized on the Austrian market, has been on the Austrian market for over 100 years.

48
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And in Germany, we are trying to develop a company in its own range, according to our own plans and projects, which we consider to be the right ones for the German market.

49
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Now we would like to bring you closer, from our point of view, to the most important events that have had an impact on the activities of our companies in the last 12 months.

50
00:11:42,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In the last few years, we have been operating as a foreign company, but now we have decided to create a company, a company, a capital company in Germany.

51
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:17,000
For this reason, in order to sell more technologically complex devices such as heat pumps to customers in Germany, the trust of the client must be built and there must be a service in place.

52
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:40,000
German customers, rather technological things, want to buy a company that is registered and located in Germany. At the moment, we are already working quite intensively on the creation of an assembly team in Germany, on the production of individual, final customers for heat pumps.

53
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In the last year, since the establishment of such an information company, we have already managed to make 2 million euros of income, so at the beginning we are satisfied.

54
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Another very important thing for us is that we managed to get the permission to create a special economic zone on one of the sections for which we invest and build a new hall.

55
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Since we managed to achieve a nice profitability, our profits are large, so the impact of this fiscal burden is also quite large.

56
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Thanks to this, we will be able to do some of the activities related to the production of the assembly element for the heat pump, which will be carried out in the area of the zone.

57
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Here, too, significant fiscal savings can be made.

58
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We have just completed the construction of a new hall in the area of this zone. At the moment, production lines are installed for assembly units, for photovoltaics, for thermal collectors.

59
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:06,000
More or less the first test production is in June-July, while on a full scale from the end of the year, according to the plan, the new factory line will begin to function in this hall.

60
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We decided on a slightly different direction of development in Austria, i.e. we did not create companies from scratch. We were looking for a ready-made company that would be acceptable.

61
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We found a very interesting company with a long history as a company that used to be in the construction of heating, then in the construction of basements, and for some time it was also very much engaged in the installation of OZ solutions, heat pumps, photovoltaic installations.

62
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:56,000
On the basis of this company, we want to manage the entire Austrian market, i.e. also develop the hot trade in this country, the internet trade.

63
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This company made an income of less than 20 million euros last year. As a result of consolidation, it will be visible at the end of the year, because the company came in January at the end of the year, it will not be consolidated yet.

64
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:27,000
However, as a result of the consolidation at the end of the year, it is certainly a significant development step for our company.

65
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:40,000
These are the most important things that we wanted to present to you, and now, if you are interested in our presentation, we invite you to ask questions.

66
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you very much for the presentation. Of course, I encourage you to ask questions, the first ones have already appeared.

67
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:05,000
However, before I start reading them, I have a few questions of my own. First of all, an incredibly high increase in income in 2022, really full recognition. What were the reasons for such a dynamic growth?

68
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There was certainly not just one reason, but many. According to me, we were able to quickly assess the market properly.

69
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That is, we assessed the market that it will simply have income, it will be able to sell, it will have goods.

70
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We also talked about the fact that all the possibilities of delivery, storage and price uncertainty, a lot of companies just got scared.

71
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
They did not order the right amount of the right products, they were unable to produce their product, and they could not sell it.

72
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The company that could produce, it also took advantage of it in two ways.

73
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:11,000
First, it could sell its products, and secondly, due to the fact that these products were lacking on the market, at the same time, it looked like the margin was a little higher than normally with standard sales, where after each year you have to fight and make significant offers and competitors.

74
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:24,000
According to me, this is a good analysis of the market and preparation of a hub for such a difficult time.

75
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Are these factors, because I understand that they disappeared a bit, those that were beneficial, i.e. the lack of goods on the market, currently you are working in such an environment that this product is there.

76
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Therefore, can you expect an increase in sales or will this year be more difficult?

77
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The year will be much, much more difficult, not only for us, but also for the whole world, according to me.

78
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think that due to the fact that inflation is high, credit rates are also high, it is difficult to get a credit that you could think of, it is a cheap credit that you can afford.

79
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Therefore, the number of investments will definitely decrease. If the number of investments decreases, the number of purchased goods will not be the same, i.e. the competitiveness of these companies will have to be greater.

80
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Last year, he sold the one he had and was able to use it. Today, there will be a battle on the other side.

81
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Theoretically, the Polish market is already being signaled that it is not a market that is growing or that is behaving evenly, but it is a market, unfortunately, that is getting better.

82
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So here again, according to me, we have a good chance, because we are on different markets with our products.

83
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Last year, we managed to invest a lot of money so that we would be on the German market to a greater extent and on the Austrian market to a greater extent on other European markets.

84
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We managed to make additional certificates on the heat pump. All the markets in the European Union are markets that are state-owned, that defend the access to these goods.

85
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It is not as easy as it is in Poland. In Poland, any company can buy any product and introduce it to the market from our industry without any restrictions or problems.

86
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Austrian or French markets are markets where it is very difficult to sell our product in Poland. Unfortunately, you have to have the appropriate certificates of a given country, permits.

87
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
These markets are protected by the policy and by the government of a given country. We don't have that.

88
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's why we needed that year. It was a very nice year, because we managed to get on the lists of products that are funded in Austria and Germany and build this experience that will allow us to sell our products on these markets, I think, with the success of our country.

89
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It sounded a bit unoptimistically that this year would be difficult, but your plans are to increase these revenues and gain growth. Is it still a difficult business?

90
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes, it is still a difficult business. Our plans are always comprehensive. I think that the market and economy will be difficult this year.

91
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The same thing was very difficult for us that year, but it was perfect for us. That's why, on the one hand, I'm talking about the market and economy that awaits us.

92
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't think that we will be the ones who will not be able to use it to their advantage. We think that this year we will be able to show our positive sides and win in these situations and in the economy that we will be in.

93
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think it will be a positive year.

94
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Well, a bit of optimism has appeared. How did the sales structure look last year? What part was the export?

95
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Last year, almost 70% were sold on foreign markets, mainly on the German market.

96
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This year, I suspect that the export will increase even more after the adoption of the Austrian company. When will the Austrian company be fully consolidated?

97
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The first consolidated result will be after the first quarter on March 31st. There is one more thing to note here.

98
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The Austrian company had a moving turnover year, which started in March and ended in February.

99
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The turnover year for the Austrian company will start in March and end in February.

100
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But the consolidation will be from the moment of adoption?

101
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The consolidation will be from the moment of adoption, i.e. we will consolidate the results from February 1st.

102
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We will show consolidated results, i.e. the first consolidated report with the Austrian company will be at the end of the first quarter.

103
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Do you want to sell your products in Austria under the brand of this company or introduce the Sannex brand?

104
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
For us, it is the expansion of our sales opportunities.

105
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We will certainly sell and expand the assortment of products sold under the brand Kovac.

106
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We will also supply and lead the sales of our products to very large recipients and producers as Sannex.

107
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Please tell us about the structure of sales from the point of view of products.

108
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You have the whole range of these products.

109
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:30,000
As you mentioned, you are first associated with collectors, with photovoltaics, now there are heat pumps.

110
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What does this sales structure look like when it comes to products?

111
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Fortunately, it is perfect.

112
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
All products that are associated with renewable energy and with the thermal part of this industry are produced by us.

113
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We produce control systems with these complicated devices and entire systems, as well as each component of this system.

114
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We produce heat pumps in a fairly large range, from 3 kilowatts to 35 kilowatts of power.

115
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
We produce solar collectors, we produce containers, we produce mounting systems.

116
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Therefore, the assortment of products that we produce allows us to increase the European market very smoothly.

117
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They are not everywhere to finance.

118
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
In one country they are like that, in another one they are like that.

119
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We can also adjust from this large range of products what people want to buy in a given country,

120
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
because the government allows them to partially finance the purchase of these products.

121
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Therefore, we can sell as much as possible on each market.

122
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This is logical, but we can also adjust.

123
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Our products are distributed to different markets.

124
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
In Germany, other heat pumps are sold than those in Poland.

125
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We are different.

126
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
We have different systems that are required in the German market so that we can sell them.

127
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The assortments have to be different, so that they can be configured with heat pumps and photovoltaics, so that they can be sold.

128
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
We have adapted products for each market.

129
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The parts that sell well are financed.

130
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But how is your sales dependent on a particular group of products?

131
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Does it depend on the majority of sales or a certain number compared to another group of products?

132
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yes, it is.

133
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
In different periods of time in our company, different products are higher.

134
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
In larger quantities, they sell in smaller quantities.

135
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
For example, in recent years, products related to photovoltaics were very popular.

136
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:51,000
These products related to photovoltaics are still produced in large quantities, despite the fact that few people in Poland talk about photovoltaics,

137
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
because this preferential way of financing has ended.

138
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But in Europe, these products are still well-stocked and are a large part of our production.

139
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It is not always what is fashionable in Poland that we produce in large quantities.

140
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Rather, we look at it globally and, according to European needs, we try to adapt to production.

141
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Therefore, we are also developing production possibilities, for example, with photovoltaic mounting systems.

142
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The entire hall that is being prepared, well, actually not the whole hall, of course, but it is very large,

143
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
will serve to develop the production possibilities of mounting systems related to photovoltaics.

144
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
How have the production capacities changed after the launch of these lines in the new hall?

145
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Theoretically, the line is prepared for a new type of mounting system.

146
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We have long tried to introduce other types of mounting systems into HENEC,

147
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
which are characterized by a lower use of materials and better durability.

148
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:10,000
For example, in Austria, there is a lot of snow on the roofs and those systems must be able to function,

149
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
even with such heavy rains, 1-2 meters of snow, they must function.

150
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
In addition, we have some ideas that have been with us for a few years,

151
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and this type of machine that we have ordered will enable the production of such mounting systems.

152
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Therefore, on the one hand, the production possibilities will increase,

153
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
which is certainly an interesting thing, almost 60-70%,

154
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
but a very innovative product will also be created, which will be launched today.

155
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Do you predict that there will be a full use of these production powers by the end of the year,

156
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
i.e. there will be a request for these new products and what will be produced in this hall?

157
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
If we knew that, it would be cool.

158
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We assume that, according to the talks that we have conducted,

159
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
we were now at the exhibition in Frankfurt,

160
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
we could meet with our clients and also with new companies that are willing to cooperate.

161
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Therefore, I believe that the mounting systems that are sold today are characterized by a high cost.

162
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There, the durability of certain elements is based on the thickness of the steel.

163
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We believe that this is not a good road because the trucks are shaking.

164
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I believe that it is possible to do much better with a well-designed hook.

165
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You can save material, but you need appropriate machines.

166
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Therefore, we believe that if we use less raw materials and make a much better element,

167
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I think that we will have a very interesting product and it will be of great interest to us.

168
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay, let's move on to the questions that have already appeared a bit.

169
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I will present them one by one, as long as there are no answers to them.

170
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think we will jump a bit when it comes to areas.

171
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Let's start with something that we haven't talked about yet.

172
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
What are the issues regarding the work on Vodor?

173
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Does the company run such work at all?

174
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Vodor is behind us, years ago there were two such directions.

175
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It was geothermal and water.

176
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So Vodor a few years ago was a very difficult topic

177
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:51,000
because very few companies in Europe had research opportunities

178
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
regarding the use of Vodor in OZ.

179
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Vodor was used in the automotive industry, as well as in other industries, but not in OZ.

180
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Today, we are still collecting experience,

181
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
we are still studying the possibilities of using how Vodor could be used

182
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
for heating systems, for storing energy.

183
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It seems that the biggest disadvantage of photovoltaics for me

184
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
is the inability to store electricity for a long period of time.

185
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
We are talking about two weeks, months, two months, three months.

186
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Here, storing electricity for such a long period of time is not possible

187
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
because of financial or technical reasons,

188
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
because a standard storage of energy is 10 kilowatts, 23 kilowatts,

189
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and that's too much money because every 10 kilowatts is about 10 thousand euros.

190
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
We can accept that.

191
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We believe that Vodor would be a perfect material

192
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that can store this energy for a long period of time.

193
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And in this direction, actually, our gaining experience

194
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
on what we should pay attention to, what it should look like.

195
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We are very, very, very far away

196
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
so that we can say that this system should look like this or that or that.

197
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So we are preparing for various competitions here,

198
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
which I hope will eventually be presented,

199
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and then with these ideas we will try to get into the field of these companies

200
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
that will show the possibilities of storing and using Vodor

201
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and producing Vodor from renewable sources of energy,

202
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
including photovoltaics,

203
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and storing it for a longer period of time

204
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and using it at the moment when we will need this energy,

205
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
whether it concerns single-family homes

206
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
or larger buildings or applications in transport itself,

207
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
in production or on site.

208
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
In my opinion, it will be possible to use this Vodor

209
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
in the place where it was created.

210
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And through photovoltaics,

211
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
that is, through the use of something that does not burden the natural environment.

212
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This direction is very, very relevant and interesting to us.

213
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
What dynamics of the company's arrival are expected in the coming years?

214
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This is a very difficult question,

215
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
because on the one hand, the OZE solution market is in Poland

216
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and in Poland it is not an independent company.

217
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
In European countries it is very dependent on legal solutions

218
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and financing that the governments of their citizens offer us.

219
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
On the other hand, for sure,

220
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
dynamic increases of 100% annually,

221
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
the more and the bigger the company has its arrival,

222
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
the more difficult it is to achieve such large growth levels.

223
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Therefore, it is difficult to expect that growth

224
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
can be maintained at a level of 100% for a few years.

225
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
However, we would like it to be such above-standard increases,

226
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
which companies set somewhere 10-20%.

227
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
This is maybe a bit ambitious for us.

228
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
However, growth above 100% is again not very realistic.

229
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But this year, for sure, the company will add quite an important amount of money.

230
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yes, of course, if such one-time events such as the purchase of a company,

231
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
they automatically allow us to double the turnover in consolidated results.

232
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Therefore, the question is what plans for this year?

233
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Are you still preparing some admissions?

234
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We are still looking at the European market

235
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
for subjects that would fit our production,

236
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
our products and our activities.

237
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We are still looking at the things that would be part of our responsibility,

238
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
whether it is sales, production or such a living element.

239
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
We are currently analyzing companies that are on sale in our industry,

240
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
in Germany or Switzerland.

241
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
This would be a potentially interesting direction for us.

242
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Can we expect any new year this year?

243
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
No, we are not able to say right now.

244
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
At the moment, we do not have a company chosen

245
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
that could enter the game.

246
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We are at the stage of market observation.

247
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Something interesting can be shown all the time.

248
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
At the moment, however, there are no talks with anyone.

249
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
However, this does not exclude the fact that in two or three months

250
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
an interesting offer will appear and such talks will begin.

251
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We are open to this.

252
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
They can also agree quickly.

253
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Even now, when we say that we have nothing planned,

254
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
in a month it may turn out that in two months we will be in the game.

255
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This may also happen.

256
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We are still checking the market to see what interesting things will happen.

257
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The economic situation may also affect the appearance of new offers

258
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
or the absence of new offers.

259
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The situation is very dynamic and will continue.

260
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Therefore, I think that we are well prepared to control the market

261
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and see what is happening.

262
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
One of the elements of this strategy is also the willingness

263
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
to make potential decisions.

264
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Who is the competitor for Sanex?

265
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The competitor for Sanex in terms of products

266
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
are certainly a few European companies,

267
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
maybe two or three,

268
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
which have a very high potential in the products they produce,

269
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
i.e. they produce a large range of products.

270
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
There are certainly such companies,

271
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because we will not talk about them,

272
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
but they are such.

273
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
In Poland, rather due to the assortment we produce

274
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and in terms of quantity, we do not have competition.

275
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
There are companies that produce a similar range,

276
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
but in a very modest assortment and quantity.

277
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
What is the competitive advantage of the company?

278
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Our company has the biggest competitive advantage

279
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
due to the assortment.

280
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
We have seen several times that due to the assortment of products

281
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
that we produce for a very large assortment,

282
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
it allows us to survive very well

283
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
those periods that are worse in Europe or Poland.

284
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
If a product is believed to no longer be sold,

285
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and the sun collector,

286
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
then we have, first of all,

287
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
because we are in different countries,

288
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
it already allows us to sell this collector in larger quantities,

289
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
as well as even if we sold it less,

290
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
because then other products appear,

291
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
e.g. photovoltaics,

292
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
which is sold in larger quantities.

293
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Therefore, one product that compensates for the potential

294
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
losses that could happen on this collector.

295
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Therefore, from my perspective,

296
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I think that the biggest point of attention

297
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
is the assortment of very innovative products.

298
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Our products, we come out of the education of the poor.

299
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
We have always produced a lot of different products for someone.

300
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And that limited us.

301
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We were not able to force the introduction of innovative production methods.

302
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We simply had to produce on order,

303
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
as our clients wish.

304
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
If we sell our brand,

305
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
we have been selling our brand and our products for a few years,

306
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
we have very innovative products in the assortment.

307
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We have products that are not yet sold today.

308
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We have such products.

309
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
These are all hybrid systems.

310
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
These systems, despite the fact that they sound cool

311
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and everyone thinks they are interesting,

312
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it is not yet time for these systems.

313
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Here, the signal has to be received by developer companies,

314
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
by construction companies, by installation companies.

315
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
They have to get used to different standards.

316
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
We have such products.

317
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We are prepared to offer such products.

318
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We show them.

319
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
We train installers.

320
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We show what the advantages of these products are.

321
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I think this is the second member that distinguishes us.

322
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We do not produce the same product all the time

323
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and we simply sell it until it becomes fashionable

324
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and stops being sold,

325
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
but each of our products,

326
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
due to the very large research and development department,

327
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
is developed in terms of innovation,

328
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
in terms of production methods

329
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
and in terms of using this product at hand.

330
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Each of our products can cooperate,

331
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
change products and create very complicated systems.

332
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I think that the direction of development in the European market

333
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
is to operate entire systems

334
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
that cooperate with each other,

335
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
are intelligent and can be controlled and managed

336
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
in such an economic way.

337
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Here the question and fear comes back,

338
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
whether it is possible to treat the year 2023,

339
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I think it is about the previous year, 22,

340
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
as a one-off,

341
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and now there is a return to the normalization of sales

342
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
in the following years.

343
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Were these margins in 2022, however,

344
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
higher than what can be expected in the coming years?

345
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yes and no.

346
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
As we said, that year was definitely a unique year

347
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
for many companies.

348
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Some companies ceased to exist,

349
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and other companies grew.

350
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
This is the state that was well prepared

351
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and did not have a hard core like a tree

352
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and was flexible and could not prepare for it and wanted to.

353
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
This win, who did not do it, lost.

354
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
This year will be exactly the same.

355
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The one who does not prepare well for these changes

356
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
that are economic changes in the year,

357
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and in Poland they are visible,

358
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
this one will not go through it.

359
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You have to aggressively try to start working

360
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and prepare for the new reality

361
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
that surrounds us and will not be interesting.

362
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So these are negative things in relation to the economy,

363
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
but positive in relation to us.

364
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We believe that we have products prepared for this

365
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and we can win in this economic situation.

366
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Today we are fighting to be part of a large company

367
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
in the field of renewable energy,

368
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
but measured in European standards, not Polish.

369
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That is why we believe that every investment

370
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
as it will be in this year,

371
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
should allow us to get to this level faster,

372
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
to the level of these big companies

373
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
that can operate in the European market as a whole.

374
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That is, they can offer their solutions as a whole,

375
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
i.e. such systems.

376
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I believe that it will be a good year.

377
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The year will be bad for the economy for the state,

378
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and good for us.

379
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What are the predictions for the growth of sales

380
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
in relation to MÃ³j PrÄ…d 5.0 in Poland?

381
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Are you still focusing on exports to Germany and Austria?

382
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yes, we are focusing on exports to Germany and Austria.

383
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I will tell you why.

384
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Because we are all talking about 5.0 in the new program,

385
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but to this day no one knows what the program will be like.

386
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
There is no deadline yet.

387
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
This morning I checked, there is no deadline for the 5.0 program yet.

388
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So there are assumptions, there are predictions, as always.

389
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
We introduce a program in Poland,

390
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and this program is 100% prepared for people,

391
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
end users,

392
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
i.e. the end user does not play a role.

393
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
He will be glad that such a program has been created,

394
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
because he can use it.

395
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But please note that these programs are not consulted,

396
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
they are not prepared with companies that are supposed to take part in it.

397
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
This is only half of the matter.

398
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If we knew that we would need energy warehouses in a year,

399
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Polish companies, Polish entrepreneurs

400
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
could produce such warehouses, take part,

401
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
build the second part of this economy.

402
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Production companies would hire people,

403
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
people would buy products,

404
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
companies would buy products,

405
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
co-products would produce all the products

406
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
that this end user could buy.

407
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
This is only half of the matter.

408
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
We will probably find out in this day,

409
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
when the program will enter life or the day before,

410
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
what will be financed and what will happen.

411
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Every company that wants to make money

412
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
will have to buy it somewhere outside,

413
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
or be lucky and buy it in Poland,

414
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
because it will turn out that someone has it.

415
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
After all, it is a bit illogical.

416
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
In the end, in Poland, in terms of production,

417
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
it would be very, very unfair

418
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
to our employees and to our workers.

419
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We would never know in our lives

420
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
how much money is intended for this.

421
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
When they finish, it would be impossible to plan.

422
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Production companies have to plan on a scale of two years,

423
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
minimum.

424
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
A year is waiting for ordering a machine.

425
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
If we do not know what kind of product

426
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
will be financed, how are we supposed to produce it,

427
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
how will we wait for the machine?

428
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
This does not work.

429
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Therefore, the main security of production opportunities,

430
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
as well as the implementation of new products,

431
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
are foreign countries.

432
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
They guarantee the continued sale of our products.

433
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And whether we get to pin 0 or 6.0 in Poland,

434
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
we will see.

435
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But whether it will be the whole system,

436
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
whether it will be half of the system,

437
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
whether we will be able to produce it, we do not know.

438
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
A year ago there were quite a few concerns

439
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
about the costs, in particular, how much steel has grown.

440
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The situation on the steel market has changed,

441
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
it is positive, I think, for companies.

442
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
However, other costs are growing, energy, gas,

443
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
rewards. How does it look for you?

444
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We are trying to take into account

445
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
things that are obvious.

446
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It was obvious last year

447
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
that the costs and logistics of delivery,

448
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
delivery chains, that they would be difficult.

449
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We took it into account,

450
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
we managed to predict some market situations

451
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and react well to them.

452
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Today we know for sure that energy costs

453
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
will not be drastically cheaper.

454
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Rather, they will be the same or more expensive.

455
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Maybe they will not be as expensive as everyone expects,

456
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
but they will definitely be more expensive.

457
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
These are things that are stable.

458
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
If we know these things that will probably happen,

459
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
we can react to them and prepare for it.

460
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
That is, either negotiate materials,

461
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
use others, negotiate prices

462
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
or construct a technological process

463
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
in such a way that it uses less energy.

464
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
We can use photovoltaic panels

465
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
to use the amount of current that is used

466
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
to create it ourselves.

467
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We take advantage of all these possibilities.

468
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
We try to present to each of these possibilities

469
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
the consequences of what will happen

470
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
in order to prepare for them.

471
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It is clear that we are able to

472
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
negotiate with all the consequences,

473
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
but if someone is already thinking about this topic,

474
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
we can predict certain things

475
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
that will probably happen.

476
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I think that we are being prepared

477
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
by a good company for such difficult times

478
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
to avoid all the unfortunate situations

479
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
that will arise.

480
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I think that this way will not be interesting.

481
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Therefore, it requires again

482
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
the use of certain visualizations

483
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
of possible events

484
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and trying to avoid them.

485
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Do you have energy prices

486
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
secured in any way

487
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
or do you buy it on a regular basis?

488
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
We have energy prices secured

489
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
at the level of the previous year,

490
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
so if there were any drastic moves

491
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
in this year,

492
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
it should not touch us.

493
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Do you provide an emission of shares

494
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
in order to finance further investments?

495
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It is always an open topic

496
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
in the open market.

497
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
If, for example,

498
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
an interesting large company appears,

499
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
we will consider such a step.

500
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
However, at the moment,

501
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
we either implement these current investments

502
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
with our own funds or with bank financing.

503
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
However, if a large investment

504
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
appears on the horizon,

505
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
we will consider it an open issue.

506
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
After all, these are companies on the stock market,

507
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
so as to provide some financial development

508
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and income from the capital market.

509
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
We also have to consider

510
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
that the price of our companies

511
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
is very, very, very, very, very low.

512
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
From my point of view,

513
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
a quick decision

514
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
on some emissions and such things

515
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
theoretically does not exist.

516
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I believe that we are very, very undervalued

517
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
because we are not yet a very recognizable brand

518
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
in Poland,

519
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
but in Europe more.

520
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
First, we should work on the high value

521
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
of our company.

522
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I think that one share is already undervalued on the stock market.

523
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Of course, questions are also being asked about the price.

524
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Despite the continuous development of the company,

525
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
excellent results from the financial report

526
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
of the Sannex shares fell from PLN 30 to 20.

527
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Are you able to explain this logically?

528
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
No, and I am.

529
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I believe that we should not have any positive ...

530
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
We have been making positive announcements for the last five years.

531
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
All in turn, every quarter better,

532
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
100%, 200%.

533
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I think this is a mistake.

534
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
We should not say anything, then it will probably be okay.

535
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
When we look at companies from our industry,

536
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
everyone has a problem.

537
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
One has millions, millions, millions,

538
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
more credits than profits,

539
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
it almost stopped functioning, something else,

540
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and everyone has a nice price, much higher.

541
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And we have Sannex, positive announcements,

542
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
and we do not have a price.

543
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Of course, there is such a correctness.

544
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
After every positive announcement, the shares fall.

545
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'm afraid it will be the end of the quarter, it will be a tragedy.

546
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Okay, so there will be good quarter results.

547
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
How are the shares supposed to fall?

548
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Okay, the second question.

549
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I understand that you feel that this is a big undervaluing,

550
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
that you have ambitions to be a company at the European level

551
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and appreciated by this prism

552
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
to beat the next European markets,

553
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and not only by the prism of Polish photovoltaics,

554
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
as many people qualify you.

555
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Great.

556
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Okay, now the question is about the funds in the other direction.

557
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Can you say something about the dividends this year?

558
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I mean, there will definitely be dividends this year.

559
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
How much exactly will it be,

560
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
we are still conducting analyzes here,

561
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
how much money we will need for investment,

562
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
how much we can afford to pay,

563
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
such analyzes are going on, there will definitely be.

564
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It will probably be closer to the annual level,

565
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
maybe a little higher.

566
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Well, from our perspective, as we always say,

567
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
we wanted to be a company for a few years,

568
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
we are a company of the Domona dividend.

569
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
For today,

570
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
from the perspective of pricing

571
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
or the friendliness of the market,

572
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
looking at us, I mean, it does not have much influence.

573
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So, but we stay with the assumptions

574
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
that we made at the beginning.

575
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
The question is about the shares,

576
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
newly acquired, what are the economic plans,

577
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
construction plans, their destination

578
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and when are the investments planned for them?

579
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Investments in the shares are scheduled

580
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
all the time, so here we have

581
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
for a few years there is no period

582
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
that investments should be conducted.

583
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Investments are either very large,

584
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
very large amounts that consume a lot of energy

585
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
or those that end or start.

586
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So the shares that the company has managed to buy

587
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
are conducted all the time.

588
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
These houses are renovated,

589
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
they are prepared for their goals

590
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
that we have there.

591
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Every year, theoretically,

592
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
we have some new big investment

593
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that we give away or some house that we need

594
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
to produce or store.

595
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
These investments, probably from my point of view,

596
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I've been sitting here for a long time

597
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
as a president and I think

598
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I have more experience than one client.

599
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
We build all the time, and all the time it is too little.

600
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So there is no way that I will say,

601
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
oh, now we will finish and then we will not build for two years,

602
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
we will probably be even more.

603
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Investments are conducted all the time,

604
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
it also requires the robotization

605
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
of the industry of our production processes.

606
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
We are implementing very innovative

607
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
production processes,

608
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
it was necessary to show later

609
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
a larger majority.

610
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
If we produce something where normally

611
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
in the industry, for example, 100 welders

612
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
we have three robots

613
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
that do it automatically,

614
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
maybe this investment is expensive at the beginning,

615
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
maybe it is difficult because it requires other people

616
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
to handle these things, to program, to supervise,

617
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
then in the final effect,

618
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
with greater production and so on, it shows

619
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
that it was a very good decision and it pays off

620
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
to make this decision.

621
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
How do Western companies achieve higher margins than in Poland?

622
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Well, yes,

623
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
to put it bluntly,

624
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
generally, yes,

625
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
because, after all, the market in Poland is still cheaper,

626
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
which is competitive

627
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
in relation to the West.

628
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
However, with standard products

629
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
that are produced in large quantities,

630
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
then you have to sweat a lot

631
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
to be able to offer products and have nice clients

632
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
and deliver to the market.

633
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
This is how it looks,

634
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
depending on the product, but in principle,

635
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
the market as a producer in Poland,

636
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
compared to the Polish market,

637
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
the market may be bigger.

638
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
There is such a question that I would also like to ask

639
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
after a few years of product sales,

640
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the target base of customers will be huge,

641
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
and in the company great know-how.

642
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It would be possible to offer high-margin services

643
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
on your own various products, I understand probably

644
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
some warranty services or something additional,

645
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
but my question is more on the other side.

646
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Who is your client? Is it a physical person

647
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
who decides on a given product?

648
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Who really is the main client?

649
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Difficult question,

650
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
because in Poland our client is the municipality,

651
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
we are very large,

652
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
we do municipal sales,

653
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
we have a municipality client,

654
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
we have a lot of montages made,

655
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
we have a final client,

656
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
even if we sell through distributors,

657
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
our client is the final client

658
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
who would, for example,

659
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
expect a service or an operational review

660
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
or other things.

661
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So here we lead a very large part

662
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
of our activities to this day.

663
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
There are such activities as

664
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
offering a disc,

665
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
this disc was our name,

666
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
before this disc,

667
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
a well-known disc,

668
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
remains with this disc,

669
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
which offers security

670
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
in relation to the extended warranty

671
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
of the 24-hour service.

672
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So here all these additional components,

673
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
in addition to sales themselves,

674
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
begin to play a big role.

675
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
We try to resummulate

676
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and properly divide

677
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
and guarantee this final client

678
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
or this municipality

679
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
or this foreign client

680
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
or company the appropriate range of action.

681
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It's not that simple,

682
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
because in Germany there is something else

683
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
expected, in Austria something else,

684
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
so we try and believe

685
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
that this aspect

686
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and type of activity

687
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
will continue to gain

688
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
the appropriate range of action in a few years.

689
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I would just like to add

690
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
that our Austrian company,

691
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
which we have bought, has already achieved

692
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
a fairly large share of income

693
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
in terms of service and warranty services.

694
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
They have a larger percentage share

695
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
than we try to achieve,

696
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
so maybe we'll take a look at them a little bit

697
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
as to who is organized,

698
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
but there you have already managed to do it.

699
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
We were talking about foreign acquisitions,

700
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
we were talking about departments that you have,

701
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
which you invest in, and are new investments in the country planned

702
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
rather not.

703
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Rather not, because of the super cool frame

704
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
that we have,

705
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I think we have our good results

706
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and all our successes,

707
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
which in the first place are the responsibilities

708
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
of our people.

709
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
We have these people here,

710
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
our employees have been working for many years,

711
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
we have a very nice frame,

712
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
everyone is involved,

713
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
so here is our great victory

714
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
that we have such a team and not another.

715
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
This is our common success,

716
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
so I think we shouldn't invest in other places

717
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
because it would be difficult to build such a team

718
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
and such a management in a short period of time,

719
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
so we will rather try to keep

720
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
our production going

721
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
in the long run.

722
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
If we are already talking about employees,

723
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
what model of change work is currently being carried out?

724
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Three changes.

725
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Three changes.

726
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So there is a lot of work.

727
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yes, there is a lot of work, so we are working on three changes

728
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
or two changes, depending on the product,

729
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
A question about liabilities.

730
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
The liabilities from the delivery title

731
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
increased to 51 million from 16.5 at the end of 2021.

732
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
How many pre-determined liabilities were there?

733
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I was the first one, it was over 30%,

734
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
and does one client dominate there?

735
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
At the moment, we do not have any pre-determined

736
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and longer liabilities, of course,

737
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
a few three or four days a week is the standard,

738
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
we do not have any risk,

739
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
all these liabilities from large clients are secured,

740
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
we do not see such a risk,

741
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
we have also normalized the way of calculating

742
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
with our associated companies,

743
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
so we do not see any risk there.

744
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
The question is, if you are developing so quickly,

745
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
do you have any problems with the staff in the Polish market?

746
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Are you looking for specialists?

747
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Yes, this is the biggest problem

748
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
when it comes to dynamic development.

749
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
If the company develops at a pace of 20%,

750
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
then there would be no problem,

751
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
because the staff is like us on a regular basis,

752
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
so we are very engaged in employing people

753
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
after school, after practice,

754
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and after all possible directions,

755
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
if you want to come to us to work,

756
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
to try to make it possible,

757
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
as much as possible,

758
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
when crossing a certain speed of development

759
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
it is difficult, because not all employees

760
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
want to advance so quickly,

761
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
maybe it's funny, but that's how it is,

762
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
some people feel good in this work

763
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
and in the positions they are,

764
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and looking for people who will help us in this fast development

765
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
is really a big problem for us,

766
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and we are looking all the time,

767
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
maybe it looks funny,

768
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
all the time we are looking for at least 10-20 people

769
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
only to manage different processes

770
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
or to manage different aspects of social activities.

771
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
What percentage of sales generates the largest customers?

772
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I think no more than 25%.

773
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I would like to ask about the negotiations

774
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
about which there was talk.

775
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We are talking about the Polish Ecology of Negotiations.

776
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
How does the development of an independent company look like?

777
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Do you acquire more such negotiations

778
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
from the municipalities?

779
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
What does the market look like for this type of services?

780
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Surprisingly good.

781
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I thought that this period was difficult

782
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
in that year,

783
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
because organising negotiations

784
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
always took many months,

785
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
so municipalities, when they had prices,

786
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
theoretically they had to make negotiations

787
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that were no longer relevant in terms of prices,

788
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
because these prices grew much faster

789
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
than the pace of organising these negotiations.

790
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
However, we managed

791
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
to finish the year positively.

792
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
We finished this year positively

793
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
before the Polish Ecology of Negotiations,

794
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
and this year looks much better.

795
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I mean, the prices of negotiations

796
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
are more realistic,

797
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
we have won a lot of negotiations,

798
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and I think that 3-5 months in advance

799
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
we have already organised what and where we will edit,

800
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
in terms of quality.

801
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
We are well prepared.

802
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
In general, the assumption of negotiations

803
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
was that there would be a second sales leg in Poland,

804
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
in case there were some restrictions

805
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
on what we see now.

806
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It is very good for us that we have in Poland

807
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
a second sales leg,

808
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
where the funds are not for individual clients,

809
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
who have less and less of it,

810
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
but those who still have access

811
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
to external European financing.

812
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
We hope that this access will be even greater.

813
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
These losses are possible

814
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
for individual clients.

815
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Thank you for your time

816
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and the willingness to meet with investors,

817
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
of whom there are nearly 100 online,

818
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
and probably more will watch it later.

819
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
There was a question on the chat

820
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
whether there is a chance for open days for investors.

821
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yes, for now we have parking lots

822
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
with cars that come for goods.

823
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I was looking at it recently,

824
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and I thought that it would be nice

825
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
to do something like that.

826
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
We do not have huge parking lots,

827
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
but all of them are parked with cars

828
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
that are waiting for goods.

829
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It is a very nice idea,

830
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
and I think that time would be right

831
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
to do something like that,

832
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
because it would give a lot.

833
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
The hour has passed quickly.

834
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Thank you very much.

835
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I understand that you have ambitions

836
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
that are not local,

837
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
but European when it comes to sales.

838
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
We have to look at you as those

839
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
who deliver goods to these developed markets,

840
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Germany, now Austria,

841
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
where it is very difficult for others to enter

842
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
the market.

843
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I understand that you are very dissatisfied

844
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
with the current exchange rates,

845
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
but I think that through the results

846
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
you will prove that it is worth investing in you.

847
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Thank you very much.

848
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Goodbye.
