0	13000	Hello, hello, Paweł Malik, Portal Analiz. It is a pleasure for me to welcome today the representatives of the company Sanex,
13000	18000	i.e. Mr. Romuald Kaliciak and Mr. Marc Kosman. Hello, gentlemen.
18000	33000	Sanex is definitely one of the stars of last year. At the beginning of last year, I will remind you, we had a webinar with the current gentlemen from the office.
33000	40000	At that time, it was a very optimistic attitude, but with some concerns about the costs, in particular the costs of steel.
41000	49000	However, it turned out that this year was phenomenal and probably exceeded your expectations. I think we will hear that for sure.
49000	59000	However, of course, what interests us most is not only history, but also the future, which can be expected in the upcoming 2023.
59000	67000	I think the environment will benefit, as the gentlemen have prepared for it. I give you my voice. I know that there will be a presentation at the beginning.
67000	76000	After the presentation, there will be time to ask questions. You can already enter the questions in the chat, which I will read out at the end of the presentation.
76000	82000	So, once again, Mr. Witam, I give you my voice. Thank you very much.
82000	96000	We have prepared a short presentation here to make it easier to ask questions and show our company what has changed this year, that year, actually.
96000	104000	And show a few directions or proposals for the development of our company in the coming years, in particular this year.
107000	118000	So, one by one, first of all, such basic information about the company for those of you who may not know us yet, but would like to better understand what the company is doing.
118000	124000	Then a short presentation of the financial results for the last year.
124000	138000	Then information about the market, where we sell, to whom we sell, on which markets, to whom we would like to sell and a overview of the most important events that have been happening in our company for the last year.
138000	156000	So, as we have already been presented, we will try today with Mr. Mark, who is our member of the financial detector management and, in my opinion, to present in such a way that everyone will be able to draw from it the information that we intend.
156000	174000	So, let's start with the company. The company has a lot of experience in relation to all products and all technologies that have been used since the very beginning of the renewable energy industry.
174000	186000	We have an experience of 20 years, as it was shown here, although the company started in 1997 as a different subject in this industry.
186000	215000	Here we show our company, as if in such a basement, as it was shown here, that is, we show a large range of our products, we show future directions, such as fruit, we show the results that have grown very nicely for us here in that year, so we would like to focus on this now, in particular.
215000	231000	What are we specializing in here? Our company, from my point of view, is mistakenly, every time it is encrypted into some parts of this large range of renewable energy products.
231000	247000	So at the beginning it was that we were encrypted into solar generators, which were considered products that no longer sell, later there were photovoltaics, which, due to the lack of funding, also stopped selling.
247000	263000	Now there are heat pumps that can play a big role, or not, so we have to see that this is a product that is largely dependent on the level of funding and the price of energy.
263000	275000	We produce a whole range, i.e. here, regardless of which product or which product range would be at the top, so to speak, this is how it is produced here.
275000	303000	So we produce a whole range of heat pumps, a whole range of solar, flat, or vacuum collectors, we produce power systems for photovoltaics, we finish the construction of the hall, we already produce in a very large number of containers, we produce glycol, we produce various chemical products that are used to clean or fill solar installations,
303000	317000	or to install heat pump cleaners. We produce controllers, we produce heat accumulators on the basis of phase cross-section of the solar panel, so here we have the whole range.
317000	343000	Here we show our experience in research and development activities. Every company that wants to play an innovative role or take part in the construction of the energy and wind energy market, from my point of view, should have a very well-developed research and development department.
343000	363000	The development department is the place of the company that decides on the directions that should be examined, it should introduce certain products, certain technological thoughts that could be transferred to the construction or creation of products that would be sold.
363000	376000	And it has given us the need to sell the whole system, not only the individual elements of the system, but also the whole system.
376000	399000	And as a confirmation, our research and development department works quite vigorously. These are donations that we received from companies for innovative solutions, there are quite a few, I think, especially we are proud of this autonomous heating system,
399000	420000	because it is a program that we are doing with the National Development Fund, a research program, and it shows our ability to create new, technologically advanced solutions and later commercialization of these solutions and operations of these clients.
420000	442000	Our company also has a number of different certificates that allow our products, both for heating and solar collectors, first of all, to be allowed to be sold on the Western European market and also allows the participation, funding for final customers of these devices.
442000	458000	This indicates that these devices are highly efficient and economical. Yesterday we managed to extend the ISO 9000 certificate for the entire company.
458000	477000	Now we would like to show you some financial data, because it is certainly very interesting. It's nice that we have a research and development department, that everything is developing, but all of this has to be converted into financial results later.
477000	496000	And indeed, here we have a comparison after three quarters, how much we have managed to improve profitability, i.e. these fears that the growth of the cost of raw materials, in general, the cost of activities last year, we managed to keep all these costs in our pockets.
496000	508000	And if we have an increase in revenues at the level of over 100%, then we have an increase in profitability at the level of 270%.
508000	525000	So you can see that this additional developed margin has been very nicely converted into financial results for our profits. These are, of course, data after three quarters, full financial data annually, because they will be published more in a month.
525000	538000	We also invite you to get acquainted with this. For sure, there will be no negative surprises at the end of the year, this trend will be maintained until the end of the year.
538000	562000	Here you can see nicely on the charts how we have grown in the last year, when it comes to revenues, and here are the annual revenues, because we have already shown them to the public, and net profit after three quarters of the year 2022, we have a significant increase in profits in 2021.
562000	577000	It can be said that we have managed to improve revenues very much this year and at the same time maintain the costs of activities, first of all, the costs of a few raw materials, and the personal costs of raw materials.
578000	587000	Now we will move on to the information about the market, who are we selling to, who would we like to sell to, what does it look like?
587000	600000	Well, if the financial results presented here were excellent, then the product that we have produced should be found by the buyer.
601000	609000	Here we can see that our main market, which is the German market and the Polish market, are different.
609000	615000	However, we would like to change this a little bit.
616000	621000	On this slide we show which are the key countries for us in the discussion.
622000	638000	We see Germany, Austria, Italy, Germany and a few other countries that we will try to satisfy in a greater way, as well as expand the countries that are not yet the appropriate colors on this map.
639000	645000	These are the new countries, such as France, Spain or England, where these products are very popular.
646000	658000	Here we show our two main countries, where we are trying to exist to a greater extent, which are Germany and Austria.
658000	673000	Austria, through the purchase of a company that deals with assembly, which is a large company in Austria, which is known and recognized on the Austrian market, has been on the Austrian market for over 100 years.
673000	690000	And in Germany, we are trying to develop a company in its own range, according to our own plans and projects, which we consider to be the right ones for the German market.
690000	702000	Now we would like to bring you closer, from our point of view, to the most important events that have had an impact on the activities of our companies in the last 12 months.
702000	720000	In the last few years, we have been operating as a foreign company, but now we have decided to create a company, a company, a capital company in Germany.
720000	737000	For this reason, in order to sell more technologically complex devices such as heat pumps to customers in Germany, the trust of the client must be built and there must be a service in place.
737000	760000	German customers, rather technological things, want to buy a company that is registered and located in Germany. At the moment, we are already working quite intensively on the creation of an assembly team in Germany, on the production of individual, final customers for heat pumps.
760000	772000	In the last year, since the establishment of such an information company, we have already managed to make 2 million euros of income, so at the beginning we are satisfied.
772000	784000	Another very important thing for us is that we managed to get the permission to create a special economic zone on one of the sections for which we invest and build a new hall.
784000	794000	Since we managed to achieve a nice profitability, our profits are large, so the impact of this fiscal burden is also quite large.
794000	806000	Thanks to this, we will be able to do some of the activities related to the production of the assembly element for the heat pump, which will be carried out in the area of the zone.
806000	812000	Here, too, significant fiscal savings can be made.
812000	829000	We have just completed the construction of a new hall in the area of this zone. At the moment, production lines are installed for assembly units, for photovoltaics, for thermal collectors.
829000	846000	More or less the first test production is in June-July, while on a full scale from the end of the year, according to the plan, the new factory line will begin to function in this hall.
846000	861000	We decided on a slightly different direction of development in Austria, i.e. we did not create companies from scratch. We were looking for a ready-made company that would be acceptable.
861000	884000	We found a very interesting company with a long history as a company that used to be in the construction of heating, then in the construction of basements, and for some time it was also very much engaged in the installation of OZ solutions, heat pumps, photovoltaic installations.
884000	896000	On the basis of this company, we want to manage the entire Austrian market, i.e. also develop the hot trade in this country, the internet trade.
896000	915000	This company made an income of less than 20 million euros last year. As a result of consolidation, it will be visible at the end of the year, because the company came in January at the end of the year, it will not be consolidated yet.
915000	927000	However, as a result of the consolidation at the end of the year, it is certainly a significant development step for our company.
927000	940000	These are the most important things that we wanted to present to you, and now, if you are interested in our presentation, we invite you to ask questions.
940000	948000	Thank you very much for the presentation. Of course, I encourage you to ask questions, the first ones have already appeared.
948000	965000	However, before I start reading them, I have a few questions of my own. First of all, an incredibly high increase in income in 2022, really full recognition. What were the reasons for such a dynamic growth?
965000	978000	There was certainly not just one reason, but many. According to me, we were able to quickly assess the market properly.
978000	985000	That is, we assessed the market that it will simply have income, it will be able to sell, it will have goods.
985000	996000	We also talked about the fact that all the possibilities of delivery, storage and price uncertainty, a lot of companies just got scared.
996000	1004000	They did not order the right amount of the right products, they were unable to produce their product, and they could not sell it.
1004000	1011000	The company that could produce, it also took advantage of it in two ways.
1011000	1031000	First, it could sell its products, and secondly, due to the fact that these products were lacking on the market, at the same time, it looked like the margin was a little higher than normally with standard sales, where after each year you have to fight and make significant offers and competitors.
1031000	1044000	According to me, this is a good analysis of the market and preparation of a hub for such a difficult time.
1044000	1059000	Are these factors, because I understand that they disappeared a bit, those that were beneficial, i.e. the lack of goods on the market, currently you are working in such an environment that this product is there.
1059000	1066000	Therefore, can you expect an increase in sales or will this year be more difficult?
1066000	1072000	The year will be much, much more difficult, not only for us, but also for the whole world, according to me.
1072000	1092000	I think that due to the fact that inflation is high, credit rates are also high, it is difficult to get a credit that you could think of, it is a cheap credit that you can afford.
1092000	1107000	Therefore, the number of investments will definitely decrease. If the number of investments decreases, the number of purchased goods will not be the same, i.e. the competitiveness of these companies will have to be greater.
1107000	1115000	Last year, he sold the one he had and was able to use it. Today, there will be a battle on the other side.
1115000	1130000	Theoretically, the Polish market is already being signaled that it is not a market that is growing or that is behaving evenly, but it is a market, unfortunately, that is getting better.
1130000	1138000	So here again, according to me, we have a good chance, because we are on different markets with our products.
1138000	1150000	Last year, we managed to invest a lot of money so that we would be on the German market to a greater extent and on the Austrian market to a greater extent on other European markets.
1150000	1161000	We managed to make additional certificates on the heat pump. All the markets in the European Union are markets that are state-owned, that defend the access to these goods.
1161000	1172000	It is not as easy as it is in Poland. In Poland, any company can buy any product and introduce it to the market from our industry without any restrictions or problems.
1172000	1185000	Austrian or French markets are markets where it is very difficult to sell our product in Poland. Unfortunately, you have to have the appropriate certificates of a given country, permits.
1185000	1191000	These markets are protected by the policy and by the government of a given country. We don't have that.
1191000	1211000	That's why we needed that year. It was a very nice year, because we managed to get on the lists of products that are funded in Austria and Germany and build this experience that will allow us to sell our products on these markets, I think, with the success of our country.
1211000	1231000	It sounded a bit unoptimistically that this year would be difficult, but your plans are to increase these revenues and gain growth. Is it still a difficult business?
1231000	1242000	Yes, it is still a difficult business. Our plans are always comprehensive. I think that the market and economy will be difficult this year.
1242000	1250000	The same thing was very difficult for us that year, but it was perfect for us. That's why, on the one hand, I'm talking about the market and economy that awaits us.
1250000	1270000	I don't think that we will be the ones who will not be able to use it to their advantage. We think that this year we will be able to show our positive sides and win in these situations and in the economy that we will be in.
1270000	1275000	I think it will be a positive year.
1275000	1285000	Well, a bit of optimism has appeared. How did the sales structure look last year? What part was the export?
1285000	1294000	Last year, almost 70% were sold on foreign markets, mainly on the German market.
1294000	1307000	This year, I suspect that the export will increase even more after the adoption of the Austrian company. When will the Austrian company be fully consolidated?
1307000	1315000	The first consolidated result will be after the first quarter on March 31st. There is one more thing to note here.
1315000	1322000	The Austrian company had a moving turnover year, which started in March and ended in February.
1322000	1338000	The turnover year for the Austrian company will start in March and end in February.
1338000	1342000	But the consolidation will be from the moment of adoption?
1342000	1350000	The consolidation will be from the moment of adoption, i.e. we will consolidate the results from February 1st.
1350000	1358000	We will show consolidated results, i.e. the first consolidated report with the Austrian company will be at the end of the first quarter.
1358000	1365000	Do you want to sell your products in Austria under the brand of this company or introduce the Sannex brand?
1365000	1371000	For us, it is the expansion of our sales opportunities.
1371000	1379000	We will certainly sell and expand the assortment of products sold under the brand Kovac.
1379000	1392000	We will also supply and lead the sales of our products to very large recipients and producers as Sannex.
1392000	1397000	Please tell us about the structure of sales from the point of view of products.
1397000	1401000	You have the whole range of these products.
1401000	1410000	As you mentioned, you are first associated with collectors, with photovoltaics, now there are heat pumps.
1410000	1413000	What does this sales structure look like when it comes to products?
1413000	1415000	Fortunately, it is perfect.
1415000	1424000	All products that are associated with renewable energy and with the thermal part of this industry are produced by us.
1424000	1435000	We produce control systems with these complicated devices and entire systems, as well as each component of this system.
1435000	1442000	We produce heat pumps in a fairly large range, from 3 kilowatts to 35 kilowatts of power.
1442000	1448000	We produce solar collectors, we produce containers, we produce mounting systems.
1448000	1456000	Therefore, the assortment of products that we produce allows us to increase the European market very smoothly.
1456000	1458000	They are not everywhere to finance.
1458000	1461000	In one country they are like that, in another one they are like that.
1461000	1468000	We can also adjust from this large range of products what people want to buy in a given country,
1468000	1474000	because the government allows them to partially finance the purchase of these products.
1474000	1479000	Therefore, we can sell as much as possible on each market.
1479000	1482000	This is logical, but we can also adjust.
1482000	1485000	Our products are distributed to different markets.
1485000	1490000	In Germany, other heat pumps are sold than those in Poland.
1490000	1491000	We are different.
1491000	1495000	We have different systems that are required in the German market so that we can sell them.
1495000	1502000	The assortments have to be different, so that they can be configured with heat pumps and photovoltaics, so that they can be sold.
1502000	1505000	We have adapted products for each market.
1505000	1509000	The parts that sell well are financed.
1510000	1516000	But how is your sales dependent on a particular group of products?
1516000	1523000	Does it depend on the majority of sales or a certain number compared to another group of products?
1523000	1525000	Yes, it is.
1525000	1531000	In different periods of time in our company, different products are higher.
1531000	1534000	In larger quantities, they sell in smaller quantities.
1534000	1541000	For example, in recent years, products related to photovoltaics were very popular.
1541000	1551000	These products related to photovoltaics are still produced in large quantities, despite the fact that few people in Poland talk about photovoltaics,
1551000	1556000	because this preferential way of financing has ended.
1556000	1564000	But in Europe, these products are still well-stocked and are a large part of our production.
1564000	1569000	It is not always what is fashionable in Poland that we produce in large quantities.
1569000	1575000	Rather, we look at it globally and, according to European needs, we try to adapt to production.
1575000	1581000	Therefore, we are also developing production possibilities, for example, with photovoltaic mounting systems.
1581000	1587000	The entire hall that is being prepared, well, actually not the whole hall, of course, but it is very large,
1587000	1595000	will serve to develop the production possibilities of mounting systems related to photovoltaics.
1596000	1601000	How have the production capacities changed after the launch of these lines in the new hall?
1601000	1608000	Theoretically, the line is prepared for a new type of mounting system.
1608000	1614000	We have long tried to introduce other types of mounting systems into HENEC,
1614000	1620000	which are characterized by a lower use of materials and better durability.
1621000	1630000	For example, in Austria, there is a lot of snow on the roofs and those systems must be able to function,
1630000	1635000	even with such heavy rains, 1-2 meters of snow, they must function.
1635000	1640000	In addition, we have some ideas that have been with us for a few years,
1640000	1648000	and this type of machine that we have ordered will enable the production of such mounting systems.
1648000	1653000	Therefore, on the one hand, the production possibilities will increase,
1653000	1658000	which is certainly an interesting thing, almost 60-70%,
1658000	1664000	but a very innovative product will also be created, which will be launched today.
1668000	1673000	Do you predict that there will be a full use of these production powers by the end of the year,
1673000	1678000	i.e. there will be a request for these new products and what will be produced in this hall?
1682000	1685000	If we knew that, it would be cool.
1685000	1689000	We assume that, according to the talks that we have conducted,
1689000	1692000	we were now at the exhibition in Frankfurt,
1692000	1699000	we could meet with our clients and also with new companies that are willing to cooperate.
1700000	1707000	Therefore, I believe that the mounting systems that are sold today are characterized by a high cost.
1707000	1712000	There, the durability of certain elements is based on the thickness of the steel.
1712000	1718000	We believe that this is not a good road because the trucks are shaking.
1718000	1723000	I believe that it is possible to do much better with a well-designed hook.
1723000	1727000	You can save material, but you need appropriate machines.
1727000	1733000	Therefore, we believe that if we use less raw materials and make a much better element,
1733000	1739000	I think that we will have a very interesting product and it will be of great interest to us.
1740000	1745000	Okay, let's move on to the questions that have already appeared a bit.
1745000	1751000	I will present them one by one, as long as there are no answers to them.
1751000	1755000	I think we will jump a bit when it comes to areas.
1755000	1760000	Let's start with something that we haven't talked about yet.
1760000	1763000	What are the issues regarding the work on Vodor?
1763000	1766000	Does the company run such work at all?
1766000	1775000	Vodor is behind us, years ago there were two such directions.
1775000	1777000	It was geothermal and water.
1777000	1782000	So Vodor a few years ago was a very difficult topic
1782000	1791000	because very few companies in Europe had research opportunities
1791000	1794000	regarding the use of Vodor in OZ.
1794000	1800000	Vodor was used in the automotive industry, as well as in other industries, but not in OZ.
1800000	1805000	Today, we are still collecting experience,
1805000	1812000	we are still studying the possibilities of using how Vodor could be used
1812000	1815000	for heating systems, for storing energy.
1815000	1821000	It seems that the biggest disadvantage of photovoltaics for me
1821000	1827000	is the inability to store electricity for a long period of time.
1827000	1831000	We are talking about two weeks, months, two months, three months.
1831000	1837000	Here, storing electricity for such a long period of time is not possible
1837000	1840000	because of financial or technical reasons,
1840000	1845000	because a standard storage of energy is 10 kilowatts, 23 kilowatts,
1845000	1852000	and that's too much money because every 10 kilowatts is about 10 thousand euros.
1852000	1854000	We can accept that.
1854000	1860000	We believe that Vodor would be a perfect material
1860000	1865000	that can store this energy for a long period of time.
1865000	1872000	And in this direction, actually, our gaining experience
1872000	1877000	on what we should pay attention to, what it should look like.
1877000	1880000	We are very, very, very far away
1880000	1885000	so that we can say that this system should look like this or that or that.
1885000	1890000	So we are preparing for various competitions here,
1890000	1896000	which I hope will eventually be presented,
1896000	1902000	and then with these ideas we will try to get into the field of these companies
1902000	1907000	that will show the possibilities of storing and using Vodor
1908000	1912000	and producing Vodor from renewable sources of energy,
1912000	1914000	including photovoltaics,
1914000	1916000	and storing it for a longer period of time
1916000	1920000	and using it at the moment when we will need this energy,
1920000	1922000	whether it concerns single-family homes
1922000	1926000	or larger buildings or applications in transport itself,
1926000	1929000	in production or on site.
1929000	1932000	In my opinion, it will be possible to use this Vodor
1932000	1935000	in the place where it was created.
1935000	1937000	And through photovoltaics,
1937000	1943000	that is, through the use of something that does not burden the natural environment.
1943000	1947000	This direction is very, very relevant and interesting to us.
1948000	1952000	What dynamics of the company's arrival are expected in the coming years?
1953000	1955000	This is a very difficult question,
1955000	1962000	because on the one hand, the OZE solution market is in Poland
1962000	1964000	and in Poland it is not an independent company.
1964000	1970000	In European countries it is very dependent on legal solutions
1970000	1975000	and financing that the governments of their citizens offer us.
1975000	1978000	On the other hand, for sure,
1978000	1982000	dynamic increases of 100% annually,
1982000	1987000	the more and the bigger the company has its arrival,
1987000	1994000	the more difficult it is to achieve such large growth levels.
1994000	2000000	Therefore, it is difficult to expect that growth
2000000	2005000	can be maintained at a level of 100% for a few years.
2005000	2010000	However, we would like it to be such above-standard increases,
2010000	2014000	which companies set somewhere 10-20%.
2014000	2016000	This is maybe a bit ambitious for us.
2016000	2020000	However, growth above 100% is again not very realistic.
2022000	2026000	But this year, for sure, the company will add quite an important amount of money.
2026000	2030000	Yes, of course, if such one-time events such as the purchase of a company,
2030000	2035000	they automatically allow us to double the turnover in consolidated results.
2038000	2041000	Therefore, the question is what plans for this year?
2041000	2043000	Are you still preparing some admissions?
2044000	2048000	We are still looking at the European market
2048000	2054000	for subjects that would fit our production,
2054000	2057000	our products and our activities.
2057000	2065000	We are still looking at the things that would be part of our responsibility,
2065000	2069000	whether it is sales, production or such a living element.
2070000	2078000	We are currently analyzing companies that are on sale in our industry,
2078000	2080000	in Germany or Switzerland.
2080000	2083000	This would be a potentially interesting direction for us.
2086000	2089000	Can we expect any new year this year?
2089000	2092000	No, we are not able to say right now.
2092000	2095000	At the moment, we do not have a company chosen
2095000	2099000	that could enter the game.
2099000	2102000	We are at the stage of market observation.
2102000	2105000	Something interesting can be shown all the time.
2105000	2108000	At the moment, however, there are no talks with anyone.
2108000	2112000	However, this does not exclude the fact that in two or three months
2112000	2115000	an interesting offer will appear and such talks will begin.
2115000	2118000	We are open to this.
2118000	2120000	They can also agree quickly.
2121000	2124000	Even now, when we say that we have nothing planned,
2124000	2128000	in a month it may turn out that in two months we will be in the game.
2128000	2130000	This may also happen.
2130000	2134000	We are still checking the market to see what interesting things will happen.
2134000	2138000	The economic situation may also affect the appearance of new offers
2138000	2141000	or the absence of new offers.
2141000	2144000	The situation is very dynamic and will continue.
2144000	2148000	Therefore, I think that we are well prepared to control the market
2148000	2149000	and see what is happening.
2149000	2153000	One of the elements of this strategy is also the willingness
2153000	2155000	to make potential decisions.
2157000	2159000	Who is the competitor for Sanex?
2161000	2164000	The competitor for Sanex in terms of products
2164000	2167000	are certainly a few European companies,
2167000	2169000	maybe two or three,
2169000	2174000	which have a very high potential in the products they produce,
2174000	2177000	i.e. they produce a large range of products.
2177000	2179000	There are certainly such companies,
2179000	2181000	because we will not talk about them,
2181000	2182000	but they are such.
2182000	2186000	In Poland, rather due to the assortment we produce
2186000	2189000	and in terms of quantity, we do not have competition.
2189000	2193000	There are companies that produce a similar range,
2193000	2197000	but in a very modest assortment and quantity.
2200000	2203000	What is the competitive advantage of the company?
2204000	2209000	Our company has the biggest competitive advantage
2209000	2212000	due to the assortment.
2212000	2219000	We have seen several times that due to the assortment of products
2219000	2222000	that we produce for a very large assortment,
2222000	2225000	it allows us to survive very well
2225000	2229000	those periods that are worse in Europe or Poland.
2230000	2233000	If a product is believed to no longer be sold,
2233000	2235000	and the sun collector,
2235000	2237000	then we have, first of all,
2237000	2240000	because we are in different countries,
2240000	2244000	it already allows us to sell this collector in larger quantities,
2244000	2248000	as well as even if we sold it less,
2248000	2250000	because then other products appear,
2250000	2251000	e.g. photovoltaics,
2251000	2253000	which is sold in larger quantities.
2253000	2256000	Therefore, one product that compensates for the potential
2256000	2259000	losses that could happen on this collector.
2259000	2261000	Therefore, from my perspective,
2261000	2264000	I think that the biggest point of attention
2264000	2268000	is the assortment of very innovative products.
2268000	2272000	Our products, we come out of the education of the poor.
2272000	2276000	We have always produced a lot of different products for someone.
2276000	2278000	And that limited us.
2278000	2284000	We were not able to force the introduction of innovative production methods.
2284000	2287000	We simply had to produce on order,
2287000	2289000	as our clients wish.
2289000	2291000	If we sell our brand,
2291000	2295000	we have been selling our brand and our products for a few years,
2295000	2298000	we have very innovative products in the assortment.
2298000	2302000	We have products that are not yet sold today.
2302000	2304000	We have such products.
2304000	2306000	These are all hybrid systems.
2306000	2309000	These systems, despite the fact that they sound cool
2309000	2312000	and everyone thinks they are interesting,
2312000	2314000	it is not yet time for these systems.
2314000	2319000	Here, the signal has to be received by developer companies,
2319000	2323000	by construction companies, by installation companies.
2323000	2326000	They have to get used to different standards.
2326000	2328000	We have such products.
2328000	2331000	We are prepared to offer such products.
2331000	2332000	We show them.
2332000	2334000	We train installers.
2334000	2336000	We show what the advantages of these products are.
2336000	2341000	I think this is the second member that distinguishes us.
2341000	2344000	We do not produce the same product all the time
2344000	2348000	and we simply sell it until it becomes fashionable
2348000	2350000	and stops being sold,
2350000	2352000	but each of our products,
2352000	2355000	due to the very large research and development department,
2355000	2358000	is developed in terms of innovation,
2358000	2360000	in terms of production methods
2360000	2363000	and in terms of using this product at hand.
2363000	2366000	Each of our products can cooperate,
2366000	2369000	change products and create very complicated systems.
2369000	2373000	I think that the direction of development in the European market
2373000	2378000	is to operate entire systems
2378000	2380000	that cooperate with each other,
2380000	2384000	are intelligent and can be controlled and managed
2384000	2387000	in such an economic way.
2388000	2391000	Here the question and fear comes back,
2391000	2394000	whether it is possible to treat the year 2023,
2394000	2396000	I think it is about the previous year, 22,
2396000	2397000	as a one-off,
2397000	2400000	and now there is a return to the normalization of sales
2400000	2402000	in the following years.
2402000	2404000	Were these margins in 2022, however,
2404000	2408000	higher than what can be expected in the coming years?
2410000	2411000	Yes and no.
2411000	2414000	As we said, that year was definitely a unique year
2414000	2415000	for many companies.
2415000	2417000	Some companies ceased to exist,
2417000	2418000	and other companies grew.
2418000	2420000	This is the state that was well prepared
2420000	2423000	and did not have a hard core like a tree
2423000	2426000	and was flexible and could not prepare for it and wanted to.
2426000	2429000	This win, who did not do it, lost.
2429000	2431000	This year will be exactly the same.
2431000	2434000	The one who does not prepare well for these changes
2434000	2436000	that are economic changes in the year,
2436000	2438000	and in Poland they are visible,
2438000	2441000	this one will not go through it.
2441000	2445000	You have to aggressively try to start working
2445000	2447000	and prepare for the new reality
2447000	2450000	that surrounds us and will not be interesting.
2450000	2453000	So these are negative things in relation to the economy,
2453000	2455000	but positive in relation to us.
2455000	2458000	We believe that we have products prepared for this
2458000	2462000	and we can win in this economic situation.
2462000	2467000	Today we are fighting to be part of a large company
2467000	2470000	in the field of renewable energy,
2470000	2473000	but measured in European standards, not Polish.
2473000	2477000	That is why we believe that every investment
2477000	2480000	as it will be in this year,
2480000	2484000	should allow us to get to this level faster,
2484000	2487000	to the level of these big companies
2487000	2493000	that can operate in the European market as a whole.
2493000	2499000	That is, they can offer their solutions as a whole,
2499000	2501000	i.e. such systems.
2501000	2504000	I believe that it will be a good year.
2504000	2507000	The year will be bad for the economy for the state,
2507000	2510000	and good for us.
2510000	2513000	What are the predictions for the growth of sales
2513000	2516000	in relation to Mój Prąd 5.0 in Poland?
2516000	2519000	Are you still focusing on exports to Germany and Austria?
2519000	2522000	Yes, we are focusing on exports to Germany and Austria.
2522000	2524000	I will tell you why.
2524000	2527000	Because we are all talking about 5.0 in the new program,
2527000	2530000	but to this day no one knows what the program will be like.
2530000	2532000	There is no deadline yet.
2532000	2535000	This morning I checked, there is no deadline for the 5.0 program yet.
2535000	2539000	So there are assumptions, there are predictions, as always.
2539000	2542000	We introduce a program in Poland,
2542000	2547000	and this program is 100% prepared for people,
2547000	2549000	end users,
2549000	2552000	i.e. the end user does not play a role.
2552000	2555000	He will be glad that such a program has been created,
2555000	2557000	because he can use it.
2557000	2561000	But please note that these programs are not consulted,
2561000	2565000	they are not prepared with companies that are supposed to take part in it.
2565000	2568000	This is only half of the matter.
2568000	2573000	If we knew that we would need energy warehouses in a year,
2573000	2576000	Polish companies, Polish entrepreneurs
2576000	2579000	could produce such warehouses, take part,
2579000	2582000	build the second part of this economy.
2582000	2585000	Production companies would hire people,
2585000	2587000	people would buy products,
2587000	2589000	companies would buy products,
2589000	2592000	co-products would produce all the products
2592000	2595000	that this end user could buy.
2595000	2597000	This is only half of the matter.
2597000	2600000	We will probably find out in this day,
2600000	2603000	when the program will enter life or the day before,
2603000	2606000	what will be financed and what will happen.
2606000	2609000	Every company that wants to make money
2609000	2612000	will have to buy it somewhere outside,
2612000	2615000	or be lucky and buy it in Poland,
2615000	2618000	because it will turn out that someone has it.
2618000	2621000	After all, it is a bit illogical.
2621000	2624000	In the end, in Poland, in terms of production,
2624000	2627000	it would be very, very unfair
2627000	2630000	to our employees and to our workers.
2630000	2633000	We would never know in our lives
2633000	2636000	how much money is intended for this.
2636000	2639000	When they finish, it would be impossible to plan.
2639000	2642000	Production companies have to plan on a scale of two years,
2642000	2644000	minimum.
2644000	2647000	A year is waiting for ordering a machine.
2647000	2650000	If we do not know what kind of product
2650000	2653000	will be financed, how are we supposed to produce it,
2653000	2656000	how will we wait for the machine?
2656000	2659000	This does not work.
2659000	2662000	Therefore, the main security of production opportunities,
2662000	2665000	as well as the implementation of new products,
2665000	2668000	are foreign countries.
2668000	2671000	They guarantee the continued sale of our products.
2671000	2674000	And whether we get to pin 0 or 6.0 in Poland,
2674000	2677000	we will see.
2677000	2680000	But whether it will be the whole system,
2680000	2683000	whether it will be half of the system,
2683000	2686000	whether we will be able to produce it, we do not know.
2686000	2689000	A year ago there were quite a few concerns
2689000	2692000	about the costs, in particular, how much steel has grown.
2692000	2695000	The situation on the steel market has changed,
2695000	2698000	it is positive, I think, for companies.
2698000	2701000	However, other costs are growing, energy, gas,
2701000	2704000	rewards. How does it look for you?
2705000	2708000	We are trying to take into account
2708000	2711000	things that are obvious.
2711000	2714000	It was obvious last year
2714000	2717000	that the costs and logistics of delivery,
2717000	2720000	delivery chains, that they would be difficult.
2720000	2723000	We took it into account,
2723000	2726000	we managed to predict some market situations
2726000	2729000	and react well to them.
2729000	2732000	Today we know for sure that energy costs
2732000	2735000	will not be drastically cheaper.
2735000	2738000	Rather, they will be the same or more expensive.
2738000	2741000	Maybe they will not be as expensive as everyone expects,
2741000	2744000	but they will definitely be more expensive.
2744000	2747000	These are things that are stable.
2747000	2750000	If we know these things that will probably happen,
2750000	2753000	we can react to them and prepare for it.
2753000	2756000	That is, either negotiate materials,
2756000	2759000	use others, negotiate prices
2759000	2762000	or construct a technological process
2762000	2765000	in such a way that it uses less energy.
2765000	2768000	We can use photovoltaic panels
2768000	2771000	to use the amount of current that is used
2771000	2774000	to create it ourselves.
2774000	2777000	We take advantage of all these possibilities.
2777000	2780000	We try to present to each of these possibilities
2780000	2783000	the consequences of what will happen
2783000	2786000	in order to prepare for them.
2786000	2789000	It is clear that we are able to
2789000	2792000	negotiate with all the consequences,
2792000	2795000	but if someone is already thinking about this topic,
2795000	2798000	we can predict certain things
2798000	2801000	that will probably happen.
2801000	2804000	I think that we are being prepared
2804000	2807000	by a good company for such difficult times
2807000	2810000	to avoid all the unfortunate situations
2810000	2813000	that will arise.
2813000	2816000	I think that this way will not be interesting.
2816000	2819000	Therefore, it requires again
2819000	2822000	the use of certain visualizations
2822000	2825000	of possible events
2825000	2828000	and trying to avoid them.
2828000	2831000	Do you have energy prices
2831000	2834000	secured in any way
2834000	2837000	or do you buy it on a regular basis?
2837000	2840000	We have energy prices secured
2840000	2843000	at the level of the previous year,
2843000	2846000	so if there were any drastic moves
2846000	2849000	in this year,
2849000	2852000	it should not touch us.
2855000	2858000	Do you provide an emission of shares
2858000	2861000	in order to finance further investments?
2864000	2867000	It is always an open topic
2867000	2870000	in the open market.
2870000	2873000	If, for example,
2873000	2876000	an interesting large company appears,
2876000	2879000	we will consider such a step.
2879000	2882000	However, at the moment,
2882000	2885000	we either implement these current investments
2885000	2888000	with our own funds or with bank financing.
2888000	2891000	However, if a large investment
2891000	2894000	appears on the horizon,
2894000	2897000	we will consider it an open issue.
2897000	2900000	After all, these are companies on the stock market,
2900000	2903000	so as to provide some financial development
2903000	2906000	and income from the capital market.
2906000	2909000	We also have to consider
2909000	2912000	that the price of our companies
2912000	2915000	is very, very, very, very, very low.
2915000	2918000	From my point of view,
2918000	2921000	a quick decision
2921000	2924000	on some emissions and such things
2924000	2927000	theoretically does not exist.
2927000	2930000	I believe that we are very, very undervalued
2930000	2933000	because we are not yet a very recognizable brand
2933000	2936000	in Poland,
2936000	2939000	but in Europe more.
2939000	2942000	First, we should work on the high value
2942000	2945000	of our company.
2945000	2948000	I think that one share is already undervalued on the stock market.
2948000	2951000	Of course, questions are also being asked about the price.
2951000	2954000	Despite the continuous development of the company,
2954000	2957000	excellent results from the financial report
2957000	2960000	of the Sannex shares fell from PLN 30 to 20.
2960000	2963000	Are you able to explain this logically?
2963000	2966000	No, and I am.
2966000	2969000	I believe that we should not have any positive ...
2969000	2972000	We have been making positive announcements for the last five years.
2972000	2975000	All in turn, every quarter better,
2975000	2978000	100%, 200%.
2978000	2981000	I think this is a mistake.
2981000	2984000	We should not say anything, then it will probably be okay.
2984000	2987000	When we look at companies from our industry,
2987000	2990000	everyone has a problem.
2990000	2993000	One has millions, millions, millions,
2993000	2996000	more credits than profits,
2996000	2999000	it almost stopped functioning, something else,
2999000	3002000	and everyone has a nice price, much higher.
3002000	3005000	And we have Sannex, positive announcements,
3005000	3008000	and we do not have a price.
3008000	3011000	Of course, there is such a correctness.
3011000	3014000	After every positive announcement, the shares fall.
3014000	3017000	I'm afraid it will be the end of the quarter, it will be a tragedy.
3017000	3020000	Okay, so there will be good quarter results.
3020000	3023000	How are the shares supposed to fall?
3023000	3026000	Okay, the second question.
3026000	3029000	I understand that you feel that this is a big undervaluing,
3029000	3032000	that you have ambitions to be a company at the European level
3032000	3035000	and appreciated by this prism
3035000	3038000	to beat the next European markets,
3038000	3041000	and not only by the prism of Polish photovoltaics,
3041000	3044000	as many people qualify you.
3044000	3047000	Great.
3047000	3050000	Okay, now the question is about the funds in the other direction.
3050000	3053000	Can you say something about the dividends this year?
3053000	3056000	I mean, there will definitely be dividends this year.
3056000	3059000	How much exactly will it be,
3059000	3062000	we are still conducting analyzes here,
3062000	3065000	how much money we will need for investment,
3065000	3068000	how much we can afford to pay,
3068000	3071000	such analyzes are going on, there will definitely be.
3071000	3074000	It will probably be closer to the annual level,
3074000	3077000	maybe a little higher.
3077000	3080000	Well, from our perspective, as we always say,
3080000	3083000	we wanted to be a company for a few years,
3083000	3086000	we are a company of the Domona dividend.
3086000	3089000	For today,
3089000	3092000	from the perspective of pricing
3092000	3095000	or the friendliness of the market,
3095000	3098000	looking at us, I mean, it does not have much influence.
3098000	3101000	So, but we stay with the assumptions
3101000	3104000	that we made at the beginning.
3104000	3107000	The question is about the shares,
3107000	3110000	newly acquired, what are the economic plans,
3110000	3113000	construction plans, their destination
3113000	3116000	and when are the investments planned for them?
3116000	3119000	Investments in the shares are scheduled
3119000	3122000	all the time, so here we have
3122000	3125000	for a few years there is no period
3125000	3128000	that investments should be conducted.
3128000	3131000	Investments are either very large,
3131000	3134000	very large amounts that consume a lot of energy
3134000	3137000	or those that end or start.
3137000	3140000	So the shares that the company has managed to buy
3140000	3143000	are conducted all the time.
3143000	3146000	These houses are renovated,
3146000	3149000	they are prepared for their goals
3149000	3152000	that we have there.
3152000	3155000	Every year, theoretically,
3155000	3158000	we have some new big investment
3158000	3161000	that we give away or some house that we need
3161000	3164000	to produce or store.
3164000	3167000	These investments, probably from my point of view,
3167000	3170000	I've been sitting here for a long time
3170000	3173000	as a president and I think
3173000	3176000	I have more experience than one client.
3176000	3179000	We build all the time, and all the time it is too little.
3179000	3182000	So there is no way that I will say,
3182000	3185000	oh, now we will finish and then we will not build for two years,
3185000	3188000	we will probably be even more.
3188000	3191000	Investments are conducted all the time,
3191000	3194000	it also requires the robotization
3194000	3197000	of the industry of our production processes.
3197000	3200000	We are implementing very innovative
3200000	3203000	production processes,
3203000	3206000	it was necessary to show later
3206000	3209000	a larger majority.
3209000	3212000	If we produce something where normally
3212000	3215000	in the industry, for example, 100 welders
3215000	3218000	we have three robots
3218000	3221000	that do it automatically,
3221000	3224000	maybe this investment is expensive at the beginning,
3224000	3227000	maybe it is difficult because it requires other people
3227000	3230000	to handle these things, to program, to supervise,
3230000	3233000	then in the final effect,
3233000	3236000	with greater production and so on, it shows
3236000	3239000	that it was a very good decision and it pays off
3239000	3242000	to make this decision.
3242000	3245000	How do Western companies achieve higher margins than in Poland?
3245000	3248000	Well, yes,
3248000	3251000	to put it bluntly,
3251000	3254000	generally, yes,
3254000	3257000	because, after all, the market in Poland is still cheaper,
3257000	3260000	which is competitive
3260000	3263000	in relation to the West.
3263000	3266000	However, with standard products
3266000	3269000	that are produced in large quantities,
3269000	3272000	then you have to sweat a lot
3272000	3275000	to be able to offer products and have nice clients
3275000	3278000	and deliver to the market.
3278000	3281000	This is how it looks,
3281000	3284000	depending on the product, but in principle,
3284000	3287000	the market as a producer in Poland,
3287000	3290000	compared to the Polish market,
3290000	3293000	the market may be bigger.
3293000	3296000	There is such a question that I would also like to ask
3296000	3299000	after a few years of product sales,
3299000	3302000	the target base of customers will be huge,
3302000	3305000	and in the company great know-how.
3305000	3308000	It would be possible to offer high-margin services
3308000	3311000	on your own various products, I understand probably
3311000	3314000	some warranty services or something additional,
3314000	3317000	but my question is more on the other side.
3317000	3320000	Who is your client? Is it a physical person
3320000	3323000	who decides on a given product?
3323000	3326000	Who really is the main client?
3326000	3329000	Difficult question,
3329000	3332000	because in Poland our client is the municipality,
3332000	3335000	we are very large,
3335000	3338000	we do municipal sales,
3338000	3341000	we have a municipality client,
3341000	3344000	we have a lot of montages made,
3344000	3347000	we have a final client,
3347000	3350000	even if we sell through distributors,
3350000	3353000	our client is the final client
3353000	3356000	who would, for example,
3356000	3359000	expect a service or an operational review
3359000	3362000	or other things.
3362000	3365000	So here we lead a very large part
3365000	3368000	of our activities to this day.
3368000	3371000	There are such activities as
3371000	3374000	offering a disc,
3374000	3377000	this disc was our name,
3377000	3380000	before this disc,
3380000	3383000	a well-known disc,
3383000	3386000	remains with this disc,
3386000	3389000	which offers security
3389000	3392000	in relation to the extended warranty
3392000	3395000	of the 24-hour service.
3395000	3398000	So here all these additional components,
3398000	3401000	in addition to sales themselves,
3401000	3404000	begin to play a big role.
3404000	3407000	We try to resummulate
3407000	3410000	and properly divide
3410000	3413000	and guarantee this final client
3413000	3416000	or this municipality
3416000	3419000	or this foreign client
3419000	3422000	or company the appropriate range of action.
3422000	3425000	It's not that simple,
3425000	3428000	because in Germany there is something else
3428000	3431000	expected, in Austria something else,
3431000	3434000	so we try and believe
3434000	3437000	that this aspect
3437000	3440000	and type of activity
3440000	3443000	will continue to gain
3443000	3446000	the appropriate range of action in a few years.
3446000	3449000	I would just like to add
3449000	3452000	that our Austrian company,
3452000	3455000	which we have bought, has already achieved
3455000	3458000	a fairly large share of income
3458000	3461000	in terms of service and warranty services.
3461000	3464000	They have a larger percentage share
3464000	3467000	than we try to achieve,
3467000	3470000	so maybe we'll take a look at them a little bit
3470000	3473000	as to who is organized,
3473000	3476000	but there you have already managed to do it.
3476000	3479000	We were talking about foreign acquisitions,
3479000	3482000	we were talking about departments that you have,
3482000	3485000	which you invest in, and are new investments in the country planned
3485000	3488000	rather not.
3488000	3491000	Rather not, because of the super cool frame
3491000	3494000	that we have,
3494000	3497000	I think we have our good results
3497000	3500000	and all our successes,
3500000	3503000	which in the first place are the responsibilities
3503000	3506000	of our people.
3506000	3509000	We have these people here,
3509000	3512000	our employees have been working for many years,
3512000	3515000	we have a very nice frame,
3515000	3518000	everyone is involved,
3518000	3521000	so here is our great victory
3521000	3524000	that we have such a team and not another.
3524000	3527000	This is our common success,
3527000	3530000	so I think we shouldn't invest in other places
3530000	3533000	because it would be difficult to build such a team
3533000	3536000	and such a management in a short period of time,
3536000	3539000	so we will rather try to keep
3539000	3542000	our production going
3542000	3545000	in the long run.
3545000	3548000	If we are already talking about employees,
3548000	3551000	what model of change work is currently being carried out?
3551000	3554000	Three changes.
3554000	3557000	Three changes.
3557000	3560000	So there is a lot of work.
3560000	3563000	Yes, there is a lot of work, so we are working on three changes
3563000	3566000	or two changes, depending on the product,
3567000	3570000	A question about liabilities.
3570000	3573000	The liabilities from the delivery title
3573000	3576000	increased to 51 million from 16.5 at the end of 2021.
3576000	3579000	How many pre-determined liabilities were there?
3579000	3582000	I was the first one, it was over 30%,
3582000	3585000	and does one client dominate there?
3585000	3588000	At the moment, we do not have any pre-determined
3588000	3591000	and longer liabilities, of course,
3591000	3594000	a few three or four days a week is the standard,
3594000	3597000	we do not have any risk,
3597000	3600000	all these liabilities from large clients are secured,
3600000	3603000	we do not see such a risk,
3603000	3606000	we have also normalized the way of calculating
3606000	3609000	with our associated companies,
3612000	3615000	so we do not see any risk there.
3615000	3618000	The question is, if you are developing so quickly,
3618000	3621000	do you have any problems with the staff in the Polish market?
3621000	3624000	Are you looking for specialists?
3624000	3627000	Yes, this is the biggest problem
3627000	3630000	when it comes to dynamic development.
3630000	3633000	If the company develops at a pace of 20%,
3633000	3636000	then there would be no problem,
3636000	3639000	because the staff is like us on a regular basis,
3639000	3642000	so we are very engaged in employing people
3642000	3645000	after school, after practice,
3645000	3648000	and after all possible directions,
3648000	3651000	if you want to come to us to work,
3651000	3654000	to try to make it possible,
3654000	3657000	as much as possible,
3657000	3660000	when crossing a certain speed of development
3660000	3663000	it is difficult, because not all employees
3663000	3666000	want to advance so quickly,
3666000	3669000	maybe it's funny, but that's how it is,
3669000	3672000	some people feel good in this work
3672000	3675000	and in the positions they are,
3675000	3678000	and looking for people who will help us in this fast development
3678000	3681000	is really a big problem for us,
3681000	3684000	and we are looking all the time,
3684000	3687000	maybe it looks funny,
3687000	3690000	all the time we are looking for at least 10-20 people
3690000	3693000	only to manage different processes
3693000	3696000	or to manage different aspects of social activities.
3696000	3699000	What percentage of sales generates the largest customers?
3699000	3702000	I think no more than 25%.
3705000	3708000	I would like to ask about the negotiations
3708000	3711000	about which there was talk.
3711000	3714000	We are talking about the Polish Ecology of Negotiations.
3714000	3717000	How does the development of an independent company look like?
3717000	3720000	Do you acquire more such negotiations
3720000	3723000	from the municipalities?
3723000	3726000	What does the market look like for this type of services?
3726000	3729000	Surprisingly good.
3729000	3732000	I thought that this period was difficult
3732000	3735000	in that year,
3735000	3738000	because organising negotiations
3738000	3741000	always took many months,
3741000	3744000	so municipalities, when they had prices,
3744000	3747000	theoretically they had to make negotiations
3747000	3750000	that were no longer relevant in terms of prices,
3750000	3753000	because these prices grew much faster
3753000	3756000	than the pace of organising these negotiations.
3756000	3759000	However, we managed
3759000	3762000	to finish the year positively.
3762000	3765000	We finished this year positively
3765000	3768000	before the Polish Ecology of Negotiations,
3768000	3771000	and this year looks much better.
3771000	3774000	I mean, the prices of negotiations
3774000	3777000	are more realistic,
3777000	3780000	we have won a lot of negotiations,
3781000	3784000	and I think that 3-5 months in advance
3784000	3787000	we have already organised what and where we will edit,
3787000	3790000	in terms of quality.
3790000	3793000	We are well prepared.
3793000	3796000	In general, the assumption of negotiations
3796000	3799000	was that there would be a second sales leg in Poland,
3799000	3802000	in case there were some restrictions
3802000	3805000	on what we see now.
3805000	3808000	It is very good for us that we have in Poland
3808000	3811000	a second sales leg,
3811000	3814000	where the funds are not for individual clients,
3814000	3817000	who have less and less of it,
3817000	3820000	but those who still have access
3820000	3823000	to external European financing.
3823000	3826000	We hope that this access will be even greater.
3826000	3829000	These losses are possible
3829000	3832000	for individual clients.
3832000	3835000	Thank you for your time
3835000	3838000	and the willingness to meet with investors,
3838000	3841000	of whom there are nearly 100 online,
3841000	3844000	and probably more will watch it later.
3844000	3847000	There was a question on the chat
3847000	3850000	whether there is a chance for open days for investors.
3850000	3853000	Yes, for now we have parking lots
3856000	3859000	with cars that come for goods.
3859000	3862000	I was looking at it recently,
3862000	3865000	and I thought that it would be nice
3865000	3868000	to do something like that.
3868000	3871000	We do not have huge parking lots,
3871000	3874000	but all of them are parked with cars
3874000	3877000	that are waiting for goods.
3877000	3880000	It is a very nice idea,
3880000	3883000	and I think that time would be right
3883000	3886000	to do something like that,
3886000	3889000	because it would give a lot.
3889000	3892000	The hour has passed quickly.
3892000	3895000	Thank you very much.
3895000	3898000	I understand that you have ambitions
3898000	3901000	that are not local,
3901000	3904000	but European when it comes to sales.
3904000	3907000	We have to look at you as those
3907000	3910000	who deliver goods to these developed markets,
3910000	3913000	Germany, now Austria,
3913000	3916000	where it is very difficult for others to enter
3916000	3919000	the market.
3919000	3922000	I understand that you are very dissatisfied
3922000	3925000	with the current exchange rates,
3925000	3928000	but I think that through the results
3928000	3931000	you will prove that it is worth investing in you.
3931000	3934000	Thank you very much.
3934000	3937000	Goodbye.
