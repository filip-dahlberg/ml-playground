00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello, hello, PaweÅ‚ Malik, Portal Analiz. It is a pleasure for me to welcome today the representatives of the company Sanex,

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
i.e. Mr. Romuald Kaliciak and Mr. Marc Kosman. Hello, gentlemen.

00:18.000 --> 00:33.000
Sanex is definitely one of the stars of last year. At the beginning of last year, I will remind you, we had a webinar with the current gentlemen from the office.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
At that time, it was a very optimistic attitude, but with some concerns about the costs, in particular the costs of steel.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
However, it turned out that this year was phenomenal and probably exceeded your expectations. I think we will hear that for sure.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
However, of course, what interests us most is not only history, but also the future, which can be expected in the upcoming 2023.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
I think the environment will benefit, as the gentlemen have prepared for it. I give you my voice. I know that there will be a presentation at the beginning.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
After the presentation, there will be time to ask questions. You can already enter the questions in the chat, which I will read out at the end of the presentation.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
So, once again, Mr. Witam, I give you my voice. Thank you very much.

01:22.000 --> 01:36.000
We have prepared a short presentation here to make it easier to ask questions and show our company what has changed this year, that year, actually.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
And show a few directions or proposals for the development of our company in the coming years, in particular this year.

01:47.000 --> 01:58.000
So, one by one, first of all, such basic information about the company for those of you who may not know us yet, but would like to better understand what the company is doing.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Then a short presentation of the financial results for the last year.

02:04.000 --> 02:18.000
Then information about the market, where we sell, to whom we sell, on which markets, to whom we would like to sell and a overview of the most important events that have been happening in our company for the last year.

02:18.000 --> 02:36.000
So, as we have already been presented, we will try today with Mr. Mark, who is our member of the financial detector management and, in my opinion, to present in such a way that everyone will be able to draw from it the information that we intend.

02:36.000 --> 02:54.000
So, let's start with the company. The company has a lot of experience in relation to all products and all technologies that have been used since the very beginning of the renewable energy industry.

02:54.000 --> 03:06.000
We have an experience of 20 years, as it was shown here, although the company started in 1997 as a different subject in this industry.

03:06.000 --> 03:35.000
Here we show our company, as if in such a basement, as it was shown here, that is, we show a large range of our products, we show future directions, such as fruit, we show the results that have grown very nicely for us here in that year, so we would like to focus on this now, in particular.

03:35.000 --> 03:51.000
What are we specializing in here? Our company, from my point of view, is mistakenly, every time it is encrypted into some parts of this large range of renewable energy products.

03:51.000 --> 04:07.000
So at the beginning it was that we were encrypted into solar generators, which were considered products that no longer sell, later there were photovoltaics, which, due to the lack of funding, also stopped selling.

04:07.000 --> 04:23.000
Now there are heat pumps that can play a big role, or not, so we have to see that this is a product that is largely dependent on the level of funding and the price of energy.

04:23.000 --> 04:35.000
We produce a whole range, i.e. here, regardless of which product or which product range would be at the top, so to speak, this is how it is produced here.

04:35.000 --> 05:03.000
So we produce a whole range of heat pumps, a whole range of solar, flat, or vacuum collectors, we produce power systems for photovoltaics, we finish the construction of the hall, we already produce in a very large number of containers, we produce glycol, we produce various chemical products that are used to clean or fill solar installations,

05:03.000 --> 05:17.000
or to install heat pump cleaners. We produce controllers, we produce heat accumulators on the basis of phase cross-section of the solar panel, so here we have the whole range.

05:17.000 --> 05:43.000
Here we show our experience in research and development activities. Every company that wants to play an innovative role or take part in the construction of the energy and wind energy market, from my point of view, should have a very well-developed research and development department.

05:43.000 --> 06:03.000
The development department is the place of the company that decides on the directions that should be examined, it should introduce certain products, certain technological thoughts that could be transferred to the construction or creation of products that would be sold.

06:03.000 --> 06:16.000
And it has given us the need to sell the whole system, not only the individual elements of the system, but also the whole system.

06:16.000 --> 06:39.000
And as a confirmation, our research and development department works quite vigorously. These are donations that we received from companies for innovative solutions, there are quite a few, I think, especially we are proud of this autonomous heating system,

06:39.000 --> 07:00.000
because it is a program that we are doing with the National Development Fund, a research program, and it shows our ability to create new, technologically advanced solutions and later commercialization of these solutions and operations of these clients.

07:00.000 --> 07:22.000
Our company also has a number of different certificates that allow our products, both for heating and solar collectors, first of all, to be allowed to be sold on the Western European market and also allows the participation, funding for final customers of these devices.

07:22.000 --> 07:38.000
This indicates that these devices are highly efficient and economical. Yesterday we managed to extend the ISO 9000 certificate for the entire company.

07:38.000 --> 07:57.000
Now we would like to show you some financial data, because it is certainly very interesting. It's nice that we have a research and development department, that everything is developing, but all of this has to be converted into financial results later.

07:57.000 --> 08:16.000
And indeed, here we have a comparison after three quarters, how much we have managed to improve profitability, i.e. these fears that the growth of the cost of raw materials, in general, the cost of activities last year, we managed to keep all these costs in our pockets.

08:16.000 --> 08:28.000
And if we have an increase in revenues at the level of over 100%, then we have an increase in profitability at the level of 270%.

08:28.000 --> 08:45.000
So you can see that this additional developed margin has been very nicely converted into financial results for our profits. These are, of course, data after three quarters, full financial data annually, because they will be published more in a month.

08:45.000 --> 08:58.000
We also invite you to get acquainted with this. For sure, there will be no negative surprises at the end of the year, this trend will be maintained until the end of the year.

08:58.000 --> 09:22.000
Here you can see nicely on the charts how we have grown in the last year, when it comes to revenues, and here are the annual revenues, because we have already shown them to the public, and net profit after three quarters of the year 2022, we have a significant increase in profits in 2021.

09:22.000 --> 09:37.000
It can be said that we have managed to improve revenues very much this year and at the same time maintain the costs of activities, first of all, the costs of a few raw materials, and the personal costs of raw materials.

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
Now we will move on to the information about the market, who are we selling to, who would we like to sell to, what does it look like?

09:47.000 --> 10:00.000
Well, if the financial results presented here were excellent, then the product that we have produced should be found by the buyer.

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
Here we can see that our main market, which is the German market and the Polish market, are different.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
However, we would like to change this a little bit.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
On this slide we show which are the key countries for us in the discussion.

10:22.000 --> 10:38.000
We see Germany, Austria, Italy, Germany and a few other countries that we will try to satisfy in a greater way, as well as expand the countries that are not yet the appropriate colors on this map.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
These are the new countries, such as France, Spain or England, where these products are very popular.

10:46.000 --> 10:58.000
Here we show our two main countries, where we are trying to exist to a greater extent, which are Germany and Austria.

10:58.000 --> 11:13.000
Austria, through the purchase of a company that deals with assembly, which is a large company in Austria, which is known and recognized on the Austrian market, has been on the Austrian market for over 100 years.

11:13.000 --> 11:30.000
And in Germany, we are trying to develop a company in its own range, according to our own plans and projects, which we consider to be the right ones for the German market.

11:30.000 --> 11:42.000
Now we would like to bring you closer, from our point of view, to the most important events that have had an impact on the activities of our companies in the last 12 months.

11:42.000 --> 12:00.000
In the last few years, we have been operating as a foreign company, but now we have decided to create a company, a company, a capital company in Germany.

12:00.000 --> 12:17.000
For this reason, in order to sell more technologically complex devices such as heat pumps to customers in Germany, the trust of the client must be built and there must be a service in place.

12:17.000 --> 12:40.000
German customers, rather technological things, want to buy a company that is registered and located in Germany. At the moment, we are already working quite intensively on the creation of an assembly team in Germany, on the production of individual, final customers for heat pumps.

12:40.000 --> 12:52.000
In the last year, since the establishment of such an information company, we have already managed to make 2 million euros of income, so at the beginning we are satisfied.

12:52.000 --> 13:04.000
Another very important thing for us is that we managed to get the permission to create a special economic zone on one of the sections for which we invest and build a new hall.

13:04.000 --> 13:14.000
Since we managed to achieve a nice profitability, our profits are large, so the impact of this fiscal burden is also quite large.

13:14.000 --> 13:26.000
Thanks to this, we will be able to do some of the activities related to the production of the assembly element for the heat pump, which will be carried out in the area of the zone.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
Here, too, significant fiscal savings can be made.

13:32.000 --> 13:49.000
We have just completed the construction of a new hall in the area of this zone. At the moment, production lines are installed for assembly units, for photovoltaics, for thermal collectors.

13:49.000 --> 14:06.000
More or less the first test production is in June-July, while on a full scale from the end of the year, according to the plan, the new factory line will begin to function in this hall.

14:06.000 --> 14:21.000
We decided on a slightly different direction of development in Austria, i.e. we did not create companies from scratch. We were looking for a ready-made company that would be acceptable.

14:21.000 --> 14:44.000
We found a very interesting company with a long history as a company that used to be in the construction of heating, then in the construction of basements, and for some time it was also very much engaged in the installation of OZ solutions, heat pumps, photovoltaic installations.

14:44.000 --> 14:56.000
On the basis of this company, we want to manage the entire Austrian market, i.e. also develop the hot trade in this country, the internet trade.

14:56.000 --> 15:15.000
This company made an income of less than 20 million euros last year. As a result of consolidation, it will be visible at the end of the year, because the company came in January at the end of the year, it will not be consolidated yet.

15:15.000 --> 15:27.000
However, as a result of the consolidation at the end of the year, it is certainly a significant development step for our company.

15:27.000 --> 15:40.000
These are the most important things that we wanted to present to you, and now, if you are interested in our presentation, we invite you to ask questions.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
Thank you very much for the presentation. Of course, I encourage you to ask questions, the first ones have already appeared.

15:48.000 --> 16:05.000
However, before I start reading them, I have a few questions of my own. First of all, an incredibly high increase in income in 2022, really full recognition. What were the reasons for such a dynamic growth?

16:05.000 --> 16:18.000
There was certainly not just one reason, but many. According to me, we were able to quickly assess the market properly.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
That is, we assessed the market that it will simply have income, it will be able to sell, it will have goods.

16:25.000 --> 16:36.000
We also talked about the fact that all the possibilities of delivery, storage and price uncertainty, a lot of companies just got scared.

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
They did not order the right amount of the right products, they were unable to produce their product, and they could not sell it.

16:44.000 --> 16:51.000
The company that could produce, it also took advantage of it in two ways.

16:51.000 --> 17:11.000
First, it could sell its products, and secondly, due to the fact that these products were lacking on the market, at the same time, it looked like the margin was a little higher than normally with standard sales, where after each year you have to fight and make significant offers and competitors.

17:11.000 --> 17:24.000
According to me, this is a good analysis of the market and preparation of a hub for such a difficult time.

17:24.000 --> 17:39.000
Are these factors, because I understand that they disappeared a bit, those that were beneficial, i.e. the lack of goods on the market, currently you are working in such an environment that this product is there.

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
Therefore, can you expect an increase in sales or will this year be more difficult?

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
The year will be much, much more difficult, not only for us, but also for the whole world, according to me.

17:52.000 --> 18:12.000
I think that due to the fact that inflation is high, credit rates are also high, it is difficult to get a credit that you could think of, it is a cheap credit that you can afford.

18:12.000 --> 18:27.000
Therefore, the number of investments will definitely decrease. If the number of investments decreases, the number of purchased goods will not be the same, i.e. the competitiveness of these companies will have to be greater.

18:27.000 --> 18:35.000
Last year, he sold the one he had and was able to use it. Today, there will be a battle on the other side.

18:35.000 --> 18:50.000
Theoretically, the Polish market is already being signaled that it is not a market that is growing or that is behaving evenly, but it is a market, unfortunately, that is getting better.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
So here again, according to me, we have a good chance, because we are on different markets with our products.

18:58.000 --> 19:10.000
Last year, we managed to invest a lot of money so that we would be on the German market to a greater extent and on the Austrian market to a greater extent on other European markets.

19:10.000 --> 19:21.000
We managed to make additional certificates on the heat pump. All the markets in the European Union are markets that are state-owned, that defend the access to these goods.

19:21.000 --> 19:32.000
It is not as easy as it is in Poland. In Poland, any company can buy any product and introduce it to the market from our industry without any restrictions or problems.

19:32.000 --> 19:45.000
Austrian or French markets are markets where it is very difficult to sell our product in Poland. Unfortunately, you have to have the appropriate certificates of a given country, permits.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
These markets are protected by the policy and by the government of a given country. We don't have that.

19:51.000 --> 20:11.000
That's why we needed that year. It was a very nice year, because we managed to get on the lists of products that are funded in Austria and Germany and build this experience that will allow us to sell our products on these markets, I think, with the success of our country.

20:11.000 --> 20:31.000
It sounded a bit unoptimistically that this year would be difficult, but your plans are to increase these revenues and gain growth. Is it still a difficult business?

20:31.000 --> 20:42.000
Yes, it is still a difficult business. Our plans are always comprehensive. I think that the market and economy will be difficult this year.

20:42.000 --> 20:50.000
The same thing was very difficult for us that year, but it was perfect for us. That's why, on the one hand, I'm talking about the market and economy that awaits us.

20:50.000 --> 21:10.000
I don't think that we will be the ones who will not be able to use it to their advantage. We think that this year we will be able to show our positive sides and win in these situations and in the economy that we will be in.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
I think it will be a positive year.

21:15.000 --> 21:25.000
Well, a bit of optimism has appeared. How did the sales structure look last year? What part was the export?

21:25.000 --> 21:34.000
Last year, almost 70% were sold on foreign markets, mainly on the German market.

21:34.000 --> 21:47.000
This year, I suspect that the export will increase even more after the adoption of the Austrian company. When will the Austrian company be fully consolidated?

21:47.000 --> 21:55.000
The first consolidated result will be after the first quarter on March 31st. There is one more thing to note here.

21:55.000 --> 22:02.000
The Austrian company had a moving turnover year, which started in March and ended in February.

22:02.000 --> 22:18.000
The turnover year for the Austrian company will start in March and end in February.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
But the consolidation will be from the moment of adoption?

22:22.000 --> 22:30.000
The consolidation will be from the moment of adoption, i.e. we will consolidate the results from February 1st.

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
We will show consolidated results, i.e. the first consolidated report with the Austrian company will be at the end of the first quarter.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
Do you want to sell your products in Austria under the brand of this company or introduce the Sannex brand?

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
For us, it is the expansion of our sales opportunities.

22:51.000 --> 22:59.000
We will certainly sell and expand the assortment of products sold under the brand Kovac.

22:59.000 --> 23:12.000
We will also supply and lead the sales of our products to very large recipients and producers as Sannex.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
Please tell us about the structure of sales from the point of view of products.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
You have the whole range of these products.

23:21.000 --> 23:30.000
As you mentioned, you are first associated with collectors, with photovoltaics, now there are heat pumps.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
What does this sales structure look like when it comes to products?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Fortunately, it is perfect.

23:35.000 --> 23:44.000
All products that are associated with renewable energy and with the thermal part of this industry are produced by us.

23:44.000 --> 23:55.000
We produce control systems with these complicated devices and entire systems, as well as each component of this system.

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
We produce heat pumps in a fairly large range, from 3 kilowatts to 35 kilowatts of power.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
We produce solar collectors, we produce containers, we produce mounting systems.

24:08.000 --> 24:16.000
Therefore, the assortment of products that we produce allows us to increase the European market very smoothly.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
They are not everywhere to finance.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
In one country they are like that, in another one they are like that.

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
We can also adjust from this large range of products what people want to buy in a given country,

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
because the government allows them to partially finance the purchase of these products.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Therefore, we can sell as much as possible on each market.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
This is logical, but we can also adjust.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Our products are distributed to different markets.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
In Germany, other heat pumps are sold than those in Poland.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
We are different.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
We have different systems that are required in the German market so that we can sell them.

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
The assortments have to be different, so that they can be configured with heat pumps and photovoltaics, so that they can be sold.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
We have adapted products for each market.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
The parts that sell well are financed.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.000
But how is your sales dependent on a particular group of products?

25:16.000 --> 25:23.000
Does it depend on the majority of sales or a certain number compared to another group of products?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Yes, it is.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
In different periods of time in our company, different products are higher.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
In larger quantities, they sell in smaller quantities.

25:34.000 --> 25:41.000
For example, in recent years, products related to photovoltaics were very popular.

25:41.000 --> 25:51.000
These products related to photovoltaics are still produced in large quantities, despite the fact that few people in Poland talk about photovoltaics,

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
because this preferential way of financing has ended.

25:56.000 --> 26:04.000
But in Europe, these products are still well-stocked and are a large part of our production.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
It is not always what is fashionable in Poland that we produce in large quantities.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
Rather, we look at it globally and, according to European needs, we try to adapt to production.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
Therefore, we are also developing production possibilities, for example, with photovoltaic mounting systems.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
The entire hall that is being prepared, well, actually not the whole hall, of course, but it is very large,

26:27.000 --> 26:35.000
will serve to develop the production possibilities of mounting systems related to photovoltaics.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
How have the production capacities changed after the launch of these lines in the new hall?

26:41.000 --> 26:48.000
Theoretically, the line is prepared for a new type of mounting system.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
We have long tried to introduce other types of mounting systems into HENEC,

26:54.000 --> 27:00.000
which are characterized by a lower use of materials and better durability.

27:01.000 --> 27:10.000
For example, in Austria, there is a lot of snow on the roofs and those systems must be able to function,

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
even with such heavy rains, 1-2 meters of snow, they must function.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
In addition, we have some ideas that have been with us for a few years,

27:20.000 --> 27:28.000
and this type of machine that we have ordered will enable the production of such mounting systems.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
Therefore, on the one hand, the production possibilities will increase,

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
which is certainly an interesting thing, almost 60-70%,

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
but a very innovative product will also be created, which will be launched today.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
Do you predict that there will be a full use of these production powers by the end of the year,

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
i.e. there will be a request for these new products and what will be produced in this hall?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
If we knew that, it would be cool.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
We assume that, according to the talks that we have conducted,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
we were now at the exhibition in Frankfurt,

28:12.000 --> 28:19.000
we could meet with our clients and also with new companies that are willing to cooperate.

28:20.000 --> 28:27.000
Therefore, I believe that the mounting systems that are sold today are characterized by a high cost.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
There, the durability of certain elements is based on the thickness of the steel.

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
We believe that this is not a good road because the trucks are shaking.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
I believe that it is possible to do much better with a well-designed hook.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
You can save material, but you need appropriate machines.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
Therefore, we believe that if we use less raw materials and make a much better element,

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
I think that we will have a very interesting product and it will be of great interest to us.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
Okay, let's move on to the questions that have already appeared a bit.

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
I will present them one by one, as long as there are no answers to them.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
I think we will jump a bit when it comes to areas.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
Let's start with something that we haven't talked about yet.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
What are the issues regarding the work on Vodor?

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Does the company run such work at all?

29:26.000 --> 29:35.000
Vodor is behind us, years ago there were two such directions.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
It was geothermal and water.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
So Vodor a few years ago was a very difficult topic

29:42.000 --> 29:51.000
because very few companies in Europe had research opportunities

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
regarding the use of Vodor in OZ.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
Vodor was used in the automotive industry, as well as in other industries, but not in OZ.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
Today, we are still collecting experience,

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
we are still studying the possibilities of using how Vodor could be used

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
for heating systems, for storing energy.

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
It seems that the biggest disadvantage of photovoltaics for me

30:21.000 --> 30:27.000
is the inability to store electricity for a long period of time.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
We are talking about two weeks, months, two months, three months.

30:31.000 --> 30:37.000
Here, storing electricity for such a long period of time is not possible

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
because of financial or technical reasons,

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
because a standard storage of energy is 10 kilowatts, 23 kilowatts,

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
and that's too much money because every 10 kilowatts is about 10 thousand euros.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
We can accept that.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
We believe that Vodor would be a perfect material

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
that can store this energy for a long period of time.

31:05.000 --> 31:12.000
And in this direction, actually, our gaining experience

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
on what we should pay attention to, what it should look like.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
We are very, very, very far away

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
so that we can say that this system should look like this or that or that.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
So we are preparing for various competitions here,

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
which I hope will eventually be presented,

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
and then with these ideas we will try to get into the field of these companies

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
that will show the possibilities of storing and using Vodor

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
and producing Vodor from renewable sources of energy,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
including photovoltaics,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and storing it for a longer period of time

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
and using it at the moment when we will need this energy,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
whether it concerns single-family homes

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
or larger buildings or applications in transport itself,

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
in production or on site.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
In my opinion, it will be possible to use this Vodor

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
in the place where it was created.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And through photovoltaics,

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
that is, through the use of something that does not burden the natural environment.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
This direction is very, very relevant and interesting to us.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
What dynamics of the company's arrival are expected in the coming years?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
This is a very difficult question,

32:35.000 --> 32:42.000
because on the one hand, the OZE solution market is in Poland

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
and in Poland it is not an independent company.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
In European countries it is very dependent on legal solutions

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
and financing that the governments of their citizens offer us.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
On the other hand, for sure,

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
dynamic increases of 100% annually,

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
the more and the bigger the company has its arrival,

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
the more difficult it is to achieve such large growth levels.

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
Therefore, it is difficult to expect that growth

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
can be maintained at a level of 100% for a few years.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
However, we would like it to be such above-standard increases,

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
which companies set somewhere 10-20%.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
This is maybe a bit ambitious for us.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
However, growth above 100% is again not very realistic.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
But this year, for sure, the company will add quite an important amount of money.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Yes, of course, if such one-time events such as the purchase of a company,

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
they automatically allow us to double the turnover in consolidated results.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Therefore, the question is what plans for this year?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Are you still preparing some admissions?

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
We are still looking at the European market

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
for subjects that would fit our production,

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
our products and our activities.

34:17.000 --> 34:25.000
We are still looking at the things that would be part of our responsibility,

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
whether it is sales, production or such a living element.

34:30.000 --> 34:38.000
We are currently analyzing companies that are on sale in our industry,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
in Germany or Switzerland.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
This would be a potentially interesting direction for us.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Can we expect any new year this year?

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
No, we are not able to say right now.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
At the moment, we do not have a company chosen

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
that could enter the game.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
We are at the stage of market observation.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Something interesting can be shown all the time.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
At the moment, however, there are no talks with anyone.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
However, this does not exclude the fact that in two or three months

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
an interesting offer will appear and such talks will begin.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
We are open to this.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
They can also agree quickly.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Even now, when we say that we have nothing planned,

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
in a month it may turn out that in two months we will be in the game.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
This may also happen.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
We are still checking the market to see what interesting things will happen.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
The economic situation may also affect the appearance of new offers

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
or the absence of new offers.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
The situation is very dynamic and will continue.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Therefore, I think that we are well prepared to control the market

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
and see what is happening.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
One of the elements of this strategy is also the willingness

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
to make potential decisions.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Who is the competitor for Sanex?

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
The competitor for Sanex in terms of products

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
are certainly a few European companies,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
maybe two or three,

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
which have a very high potential in the products they produce,

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
i.e. they produce a large range of products.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
There are certainly such companies,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
because we will not talk about them,

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
but they are such.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
In Poland, rather due to the assortment we produce

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
and in terms of quantity, we do not have competition.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
There are companies that produce a similar range,

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
but in a very modest assortment and quantity.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
What is the competitive advantage of the company?

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
Our company has the biggest competitive advantage

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
due to the assortment.

36:52.000 --> 36:59.000
We have seen several times that due to the assortment of products

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
that we produce for a very large assortment,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
it allows us to survive very well

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
those periods that are worse in Europe or Poland.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
If a product is believed to no longer be sold,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
and the sun collector,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
then we have, first of all,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
because we are in different countries,

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
it already allows us to sell this collector in larger quantities,

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
as well as even if we sold it less,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
because then other products appear,

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
e.g. photovoltaics,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
which is sold in larger quantities.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Therefore, one product that compensates for the potential

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
losses that could happen on this collector.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Therefore, from my perspective,

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
I think that the biggest point of attention

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
is the assortment of very innovative products.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
Our products, we come out of the education of the poor.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
We have always produced a lot of different products for someone.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
And that limited us.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
We were not able to force the introduction of innovative production methods.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
We simply had to produce on order,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
as our clients wish.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
If we sell our brand,

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
we have been selling our brand and our products for a few years,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
we have very innovative products in the assortment.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
We have products that are not yet sold today.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
We have such products.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
These are all hybrid systems.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
These systems, despite the fact that they sound cool

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
and everyone thinks they are interesting,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
it is not yet time for these systems.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
Here, the signal has to be received by developer companies,

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
by construction companies, by installation companies.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
They have to get used to different standards.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
We have such products.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
We are prepared to offer such products.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
We show them.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
We train installers.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
We show what the advantages of these products are.

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
I think this is the second member that distinguishes us.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
We do not produce the same product all the time

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
and we simply sell it until it becomes fashionable

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
and stops being sold,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
but each of our products,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
due to the very large research and development department,

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
is developed in terms of innovation,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
in terms of production methods

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
and in terms of using this product at hand.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Each of our products can cooperate,

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
change products and create very complicated systems.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
I think that the direction of development in the European market

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
is to operate entire systems

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
that cooperate with each other,

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
are intelligent and can be controlled and managed

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
in such an economic way.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Here the question and fear comes back,

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
whether it is possible to treat the year 2023,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I think it is about the previous year, 22,

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
as a one-off,

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
and now there is a return to the normalization of sales

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
in the following years.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Were these margins in 2022, however,

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
higher than what can be expected in the coming years?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Yes and no.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
As we said, that year was definitely a unique year

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
for many companies.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Some companies ceased to exist,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
and other companies grew.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
This is the state that was well prepared

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
and did not have a hard core like a tree

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
and was flexible and could not prepare for it and wanted to.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
This win, who did not do it, lost.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
This year will be exactly the same.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
The one who does not prepare well for these changes

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
that are economic changes in the year,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and in Poland they are visible,

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
this one will not go through it.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
You have to aggressively try to start working

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
and prepare for the new reality

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
that surrounds us and will not be interesting.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
So these are negative things in relation to the economy,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
but positive in relation to us.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
We believe that we have products prepared for this

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
and we can win in this economic situation.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
Today we are fighting to be part of a large company

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
in the field of renewable energy,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
but measured in European standards, not Polish.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
That is why we believe that every investment

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
as it will be in this year,

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
should allow us to get to this level faster,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
to the level of these big companies

41:27.000 --> 41:33.000
that can operate in the European market as a whole.

41:33.000 --> 41:39.000
That is, they can offer their solutions as a whole,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
i.e. such systems.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
I believe that it will be a good year.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
The year will be bad for the economy for the state,

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
and good for us.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
What are the predictions for the growth of sales

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
in relation to MÃ³j PrÄ…d 5.0 in Poland?

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Are you still focusing on exports to Germany and Austria?

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Yes, we are focusing on exports to Germany and Austria.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I will tell you why.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Because we are all talking about 5.0 in the new program,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
but to this day no one knows what the program will be like.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
There is no deadline yet.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
This morning I checked, there is no deadline for the 5.0 program yet.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
So there are assumptions, there are predictions, as always.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
We introduce a program in Poland,

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
and this program is 100% prepared for people,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
end users,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
i.e. the end user does not play a role.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
He will be glad that such a program has been created,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
because he can use it.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
But please note that these programs are not consulted,

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
they are not prepared with companies that are supposed to take part in it.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
This is only half of the matter.

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
If we knew that we would need energy warehouses in a year,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Polish companies, Polish entrepreneurs

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
could produce such warehouses, take part,

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
build the second part of this economy.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Production companies would hire people,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
people would buy products,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
companies would buy products,

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
co-products would produce all the products

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
that this end user could buy.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
This is only half of the matter.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
We will probably find out in this day,

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
when the program will enter life or the day before,

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
what will be financed and what will happen.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Every company that wants to make money

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
will have to buy it somewhere outside,

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
or be lucky and buy it in Poland,

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
because it will turn out that someone has it.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
After all, it is a bit illogical.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
In the end, in Poland, in terms of production,

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
it would be very, very unfair

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
to our employees and to our workers.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
We would never know in our lives

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
how much money is intended for this.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
When they finish, it would be impossible to plan.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
Production companies have to plan on a scale of two years,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
minimum.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
A year is waiting for ordering a machine.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
If we do not know what kind of product

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
will be financed, how are we supposed to produce it,

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
how will we wait for the machine?

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
This does not work.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Therefore, the main security of production opportunities,

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
as well as the implementation of new products,

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
are foreign countries.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
They guarantee the continued sale of our products.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
And whether we get to pin 0 or 6.0 in Poland,

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
we will see.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
But whether it will be the whole system,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
whether it will be half of the system,

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
whether we will be able to produce it, we do not know.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
A year ago there were quite a few concerns

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
about the costs, in particular, how much steel has grown.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
The situation on the steel market has changed,

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
it is positive, I think, for companies.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
However, other costs are growing, energy, gas,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
rewards. How does it look for you?

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
We are trying to take into account

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
things that are obvious.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
It was obvious last year

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
that the costs and logistics of delivery,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
delivery chains, that they would be difficult.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
We took it into account,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
we managed to predict some market situations

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
and react well to them.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
Today we know for sure that energy costs

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
will not be drastically cheaper.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
Rather, they will be the same or more expensive.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
Maybe they will not be as expensive as everyone expects,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
but they will definitely be more expensive.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
These are things that are stable.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
If we know these things that will probably happen,

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
we can react to them and prepare for it.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
That is, either negotiate materials,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
use others, negotiate prices

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
or construct a technological process

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
in such a way that it uses less energy.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
We can use photovoltaic panels

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
to use the amount of current that is used

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
to create it ourselves.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
We take advantage of all these possibilities.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
We try to present to each of these possibilities

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
the consequences of what will happen

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
in order to prepare for them.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
It is clear that we are able to

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
negotiate with all the consequences,

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
but if someone is already thinking about this topic,

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
we can predict certain things

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
that will probably happen.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
I think that we are being prepared

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
by a good company for such difficult times

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
to avoid all the unfortunate situations

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
that will arise.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
I think that this way will not be interesting.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
Therefore, it requires again

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
the use of certain visualizations

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
of possible events

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
and trying to avoid them.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
Do you have energy prices

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
secured in any way

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
or do you buy it on a regular basis?

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
We have energy prices secured

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
at the level of the previous year,

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
so if there were any drastic moves

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
in this year,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
it should not touch us.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Do you provide an emission of shares

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
in order to finance further investments?

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
It is always an open topic

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
in the open market.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
If, for example,

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
an interesting large company appears,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
we will consider such a step.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
However, at the moment,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
we either implement these current investments

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
with our own funds or with bank financing.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
However, if a large investment

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
appears on the horizon,

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
we will consider it an open issue.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
After all, these are companies on the stock market,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
so as to provide some financial development

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
and income from the capital market.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
We also have to consider

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
that the price of our companies

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
is very, very, very, very, very low.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
From my point of view,

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
a quick decision

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
on some emissions and such things

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
theoretically does not exist.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
I believe that we are very, very undervalued

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
because we are not yet a very recognizable brand

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
in Poland,

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
but in Europe more.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
First, we should work on the high value

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
of our company.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
I think that one share is already undervalued on the stock market.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
Of course, questions are also being asked about the price.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Despite the continuous development of the company,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
excellent results from the financial report

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
of the Sannex shares fell from PLN 30 to 20.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
Are you able to explain this logically?

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
No, and I am.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I believe that we should not have any positive ...

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
We have been making positive announcements for the last five years.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
All in turn, every quarter better,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
100%, 200%.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
I think this is a mistake.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
We should not say anything, then it will probably be okay.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
When we look at companies from our industry,

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
everyone has a problem.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
One has millions, millions, millions,

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
more credits than profits,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
it almost stopped functioning, something else,

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
and everyone has a nice price, much higher.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
And we have Sannex, positive announcements,

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
and we do not have a price.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Of course, there is such a correctness.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
After every positive announcement, the shares fall.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
I'm afraid it will be the end of the quarter, it will be a tragedy.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Okay, so there will be good quarter results.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
How are the shares supposed to fall?

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
Okay, the second question.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
I understand that you feel that this is a big undervaluing,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
that you have ambitions to be a company at the European level

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
and appreciated by this prism

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
to beat the next European markets,

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
and not only by the prism of Polish photovoltaics,

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
as many people qualify you.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
Great.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Okay, now the question is about the funds in the other direction.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Can you say something about the dividends this year?

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
I mean, there will definitely be dividends this year.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
How much exactly will it be,

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
we are still conducting analyzes here,

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
how much money we will need for investment,

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
how much we can afford to pay,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
such analyzes are going on, there will definitely be.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
It will probably be closer to the annual level,

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
maybe a little higher.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Well, from our perspective, as we always say,

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
we wanted to be a company for a few years,

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
we are a company of the Domona dividend.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
For today,

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
from the perspective of pricing

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
or the friendliness of the market,

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
looking at us, I mean, it does not have much influence.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
So, but we stay with the assumptions

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
that we made at the beginning.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
The question is about the shares,

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
newly acquired, what are the economic plans,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
construction plans, their destination

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
and when are the investments planned for them?

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Investments in the shares are scheduled

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
all the time, so here we have

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
for a few years there is no period

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
that investments should be conducted.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Investments are either very large,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
very large amounts that consume a lot of energy

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
or those that end or start.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
So the shares that the company has managed to buy

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
are conducted all the time.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
These houses are renovated,

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
they are prepared for their goals

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
that we have there.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Every year, theoretically,

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
we have some new big investment

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
that we give away or some house that we need

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
to produce or store.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
These investments, probably from my point of view,

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
I've been sitting here for a long time

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
as a president and I think

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
I have more experience than one client.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
We build all the time, and all the time it is too little.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
So there is no way that I will say,

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
oh, now we will finish and then we will not build for two years,

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
we will probably be even more.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Investments are conducted all the time,

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
it also requires the robotization

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
of the industry of our production processes.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
We are implementing very innovative

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
production processes,

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
it was necessary to show later

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
a larger majority.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
If we produce something where normally

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
in the industry, for example, 100 welders

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
we have three robots

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
that do it automatically,

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
maybe this investment is expensive at the beginning,

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
maybe it is difficult because it requires other people

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
to handle these things, to program, to supervise,

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
then in the final effect,

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
with greater production and so on, it shows

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
that it was a very good decision and it pays off

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
to make this decision.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
How do Western companies achieve higher margins than in Poland?

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
Well, yes,

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
to put it bluntly,

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
generally, yes,

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
because, after all, the market in Poland is still cheaper,

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
which is competitive

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
in relation to the West.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
However, with standard products

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
that are produced in large quantities,

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
then you have to sweat a lot

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
to be able to offer products and have nice clients

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
and deliver to the market.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
This is how it looks,

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
depending on the product, but in principle,

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
the market as a producer in Poland,

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
compared to the Polish market,

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
the market may be bigger.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
There is such a question that I would also like to ask

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
after a few years of product sales,

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
the target base of customers will be huge,

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
and in the company great know-how.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
It would be possible to offer high-margin services

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
on your own various products, I understand probably

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
some warranty services or something additional,

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
but my question is more on the other side.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Who is your client? Is it a physical person

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
who decides on a given product?

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
Who really is the main client?

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
Difficult question,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
because in Poland our client is the municipality,

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
we are very large,

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
we do municipal sales,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
we have a municipality client,

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
we have a lot of montages made,

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
we have a final client,

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
even if we sell through distributors,

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
our client is the final client

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
who would, for example,

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
expect a service or an operational review

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
or other things.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
So here we lead a very large part

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
of our activities to this day.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
There are such activities as

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
offering a disc,

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
this disc was our name,

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
before this disc,

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
a well-known disc,

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
remains with this disc,

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
which offers security

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
in relation to the extended warranty

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
of the 24-hour service.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
So here all these additional components,

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
in addition to sales themselves,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
begin to play a big role.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
We try to resummulate

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
and properly divide

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
and guarantee this final client

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
or this municipality

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
or this foreign client

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
or company the appropriate range of action.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
It's not that simple,

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
because in Germany there is something else

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
expected, in Austria something else,

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
so we try and believe

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
that this aspect

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
and type of activity

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
will continue to gain

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
the appropriate range of action in a few years.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
I would just like to add

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
that our Austrian company,

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
which we have bought, has already achieved

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
a fairly large share of income

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
in terms of service and warranty services.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
They have a larger percentage share

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
than we try to achieve,

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
so maybe we'll take a look at them a little bit

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
as to who is organized,

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
but there you have already managed to do it.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
We were talking about foreign acquisitions,

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
we were talking about departments that you have,

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
which you invest in, and are new investments in the country planned

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
rather not.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
Rather not, because of the super cool frame

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
that we have,

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
I think we have our good results

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
and all our successes,

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
which in the first place are the responsibilities

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
of our people.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
We have these people here,

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
our employees have been working for many years,

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
we have a very nice frame,

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
everyone is involved,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
so here is our great victory

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
that we have such a team and not another.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
This is our common success,

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
so I think we shouldn't invest in other places

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
because it would be difficult to build such a team

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
and such a management in a short period of time,

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
so we will rather try to keep

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
our production going

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
in the long run.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
If we are already talking about employees,

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
what model of change work is currently being carried out?

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
Three changes.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
Three changes.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
So there is a lot of work.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Yes, there is a lot of work, so we are working on three changes

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
or two changes, depending on the product,

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
A question about liabilities.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
The liabilities from the delivery title

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
increased to 51 million from 16.5 at the end of 2021.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
How many pre-determined liabilities were there?

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
I was the first one, it was over 30%,

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
and does one client dominate there?

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
At the moment, we do not have any pre-determined

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
and longer liabilities, of course,

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
a few three or four days a week is the standard,

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
we do not have any risk,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
all these liabilities from large clients are secured,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
we do not see such a risk,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
we have also normalized the way of calculating

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
with our associated companies,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
so we do not see any risk there.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
The question is, if you are developing so quickly,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
do you have any problems with the staff in the Polish market?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Are you looking for specialists?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yes, this is the biggest problem

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
when it comes to dynamic development.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
If the company develops at a pace of 20%,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
then there would be no problem,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
because the staff is like us on a regular basis,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
so we are very engaged in employing people

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
after school, after practice,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
and after all possible directions,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
if you want to come to us to work,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
to try to make it possible,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
as much as possible,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
when crossing a certain speed of development

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
it is difficult, because not all employees

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
want to advance so quickly,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
maybe it's funny, but that's how it is,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
some people feel good in this work

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and in the positions they are,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
and looking for people who will help us in this fast development

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
is really a big problem for us,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and we are looking all the time,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
maybe it looks funny,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
all the time we are looking for at least 10-20 people

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
only to manage different processes

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
or to manage different aspects of social activities.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
What percentage of sales generates the largest customers?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I think no more than 25%.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I would like to ask about the negotiations

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
about which there was talk.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
We are talking about the Polish Ecology of Negotiations.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
How does the development of an independent company look like?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Do you acquire more such negotiations

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
from the municipalities?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
What does the market look like for this type of services?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Surprisingly good.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I thought that this period was difficult

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
in that year,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
because organising negotiations

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
always took many months,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
so municipalities, when they had prices,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
theoretically they had to make negotiations

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
that were no longer relevant in terms of prices,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
because these prices grew much faster

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
than the pace of organising these negotiations.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
However, we managed

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
to finish the year positively.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
We finished this year positively

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
before the Polish Ecology of Negotiations,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
and this year looks much better.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I mean, the prices of negotiations

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
are more realistic,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
we have won a lot of negotiations,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and I think that 3-5 months in advance

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
we have already organised what and where we will edit,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
in terms of quality.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
We are well prepared.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
In general, the assumption of negotiations

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
was that there would be a second sales leg in Poland,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
in case there were some restrictions

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
on what we see now.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It is very good for us that we have in Poland

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
a second sales leg,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
where the funds are not for individual clients,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
who have less and less of it,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
but those who still have access

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
to external European financing.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
We hope that this access will be even greater.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
These losses are possible

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
for individual clients.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Thank you for your time

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
and the willingness to meet with investors,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
of whom there are nearly 100 online,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
and probably more will watch it later.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
There was a question on the chat

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
whether there is a chance for open days for investors.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yes, for now we have parking lots

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
with cars that come for goods.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I was looking at it recently,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
and I thought that it would be nice

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
to do something like that.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
We do not have huge parking lots,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
but all of them are parked with cars

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
that are waiting for goods.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It is a very nice idea,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and I think that time would be right

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
to do something like that,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
because it would give a lot.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
The hour has passed quickly.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Thank you very much.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I understand that you have ambitions

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
that are not local,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
but European when it comes to sales.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
We have to look at you as those

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
who deliver goods to these developed markets,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Germany, now Austria,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
where it is very difficult for others to enter

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
the market.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I understand that you are very dissatisfied

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
with the current exchange rates,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
but I think that through the results

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
you will prove that it is worth investing in you.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Thank you very much.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Goodbye.
